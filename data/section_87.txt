<h3 id="monster-movement">Monster Movement</h3><p>Once a monster has found a focus and identified its path to that focus, it then performs the abilities listed on its ability card in order — the first of which is usually to move. A monster only moves on its turn if “<img alt="Move Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-move-bw-icon.png" title="Move Icon"/> <strong>± X</strong>” is listed on its ability card. This move ability gives the monster an amount of movement points equal to its base move stat (found on its stat card) modified by X (either positive or negative).</p><p>A monster always uses the fewest movement points required to maximize its attacks for its current turn. If a monster cannot attack its focus on its current turn, it only moves if it can shorten the path to its focus. When a monster performs a ranged attack on an adjacent target, it first moves away from that target if possible, so that the attack does not have disadvantage.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> When a monster performs ranged attacks on multiple targets, it moves to attack the most possible targets (including its focus), with the fewest possible disadvantaged attacks, while using the fewest possible movement points.</p>
</blockquote><p>Having abilities other than <img alt="Attack Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-attack-bw-icon.png" title="Attack Icon"/> listed on its ability card does not affect a monster’s movement in any way. It will simply move according to the above rules and then perform its other abilities as fully as possible.</p>
