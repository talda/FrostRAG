<h2 id="1-passage-of-time">1. Passage of Time</h2><p>At the start of the Outpost Phase, time passes. Mark the next unmarked box on the calendar to signify that one week has passed.</p><p>You will occasionally be instructed to add section numbers to future weeks on the calendar. Count the indicated number of weeks past the last marked box, then write the section number in that box. When you mark a box that contains a section number, immediately read the indicated section from the section book. If there are multiple section numbers, read those sections one at a time, in any order.</p><p>In some events and scenarios, time can pass outside of the Outpost Phase. When this happens, if you mark a box that contains a section number, do not read the indicated section immediately. Instead, write the section number in the next unmarked box, to be triggered when time passes during the next Outpost Phase.</p><p>When a set of 10 boxes on the calendar has been filled, a change of season occurs — either from summer to winter (filling the first half of a row) or from winter to summer (filling the second half of a row). The main difference between the two seasons is which deck will be used for road and outpost events.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_60">60</a></strong></p><hr/>
