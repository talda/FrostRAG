<h3 id="garden">Garden</h3><p>Once the Garden has been built, the party may spend any one herb resource during the Building Operations step to affix a matching sticker to any plot. The Garden starts with only one plot, but more plots become available at higher levels. Each plot can only have one sticker at a time, but any sticker can be covered by another sticker later.</p><p>The Garden will be harvested every two weeks (or every week at higher levels) when it is not wrecked. When the Garden is harvested, for each plot with a sticker, the party gains one matching herb resource. Do not remove the stickers.</p><p>When the Garden is upgraded to level 2, make sure to keep its card in the same orientation within the building deck.</p>
