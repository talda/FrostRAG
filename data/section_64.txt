<h3 id="forced-movement">Forced Movement</h3><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Forced movement is any negative targeted ability that allows a figure to control another figure’s movement or to teleport another figure.</p>
</blockquote><p>Forced movement must follow all normal movement rules for the target. For example, if a flying figure is forced to move, flying still applies. There are two primary forced movement abilities:</p><p><img alt="Push Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-push-color-icon.png" title="Push Icon" width="42"/>  “<strong>Push X</strong>” forces the target to move up to X hexes away from the acting figure. Each individual hex entered must place the target farther by range from the acting figure.</p><p><img alt="Pull Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-pull-color-icon.png" title="Pull Icon" width="42"/>  “<strong>Pull X</strong>” forces the target to move up to X hexes toward the acting figure. Each individual hex entered must place the target closer by range to the acting figure.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> When a character performs a push or a pull, they decide the direction and distance that the target moves.</p>
</blockquote><p>When a monster performs a push or a pull, the party decides the direction, but the target must move as far as possible. Push and pull are unaffected by difficult terrain, but all other normal movement rules are still applied (including the rules for flying figures). Immobilized or stunned figures can still be affected by push, pull, and teleport but not by any other type of forced movement.</p><p>Push and pull can also be added to other abilities as an added effect, allowing the forced movement of one or more targets of that ability after its main effect is resolved. If the ability is an attack, the target can be forced to move even if the attack dealt no damage, but they cannot be forced to move if the attack killed or exhausted them.</p><p>Multiple push or pull effects are combined. For example, if an ability with “<img alt="Push Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-push-color-icon.png" title="Push Icon"/><strong>1</strong>” gains “<img alt="Push Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-push-color-icon.png" title="Push Icon"/><strong>2</strong>,” the result is a “<img alt="Push Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-push-color-icon.png" title="Push Icon"/><strong>3</strong>” ability.</p>
