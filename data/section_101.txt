<h1 id="the-adventure-begins">The Adventure Begins</h1><p>The second part of this rulebook covers how to interact with the outpost of Frosthaven and how to manage the overall campaign, none of which is necessary for your first scenario. When you are ready to start playing and officially begin your campaign, read the text at the front of the scenario book. This text will tell you that two new scenarios have been unlocked (scenarios 0 and 1).Open the corresponding windows of the scenario flowchart, retrieve those stickers, and affix them to the map board at the specified coordinates, matching up the artwork (see <a href="#page_51">p.51</a>).</p><h4 id="scenario-0-and-1">Scenario 0 and 1</h4><p>If you are new to the Gloomhaven system, play scenario 0 now. This is a short, low-stakes scenario with minimal rewards, and it is meant to familiarize you with your characters and give you a chance to practice the rules you‚Äôve just learned. If you are already familiar with the Gloomhaven system, you can skip scenario 0 and go directly to scenario 1, the first official scenario of the campaign. Once you have completed scenario 1, you are ready to read the rest of this rulebook and learn about the Outpost Phase, which occurs between scenarios. There is no Outpost Phase between scenarios 0 and 1.</p><blockquote>
