<h3 id="brew-potions">Brew Potions</h3><p>Potion items can be brewed by interacting with the Alchemist building. Characters brew a potion by spending any two herb resources, taken from the Frosthaven supply or their personal supply, in any combination. Refer to the combination of those two herbs on the alchemy chart to see which potion is brewed. The brewing character gains one copy of the brewed potion, which they may keep or immediately give to another member of the party.</p><p>At the start of the campaign, all windows on the alchemy chart are closed, so the potion formulas are unknown. The first time that a new combination is brewed during the campaign, open and tear off the corresponding window of the alchemy chart to reveal the potion. Once the potion has been revealed, the action cannot be undone. After the brewing character gains one copy of the brewed potion, move all remaining copies to the available craftable supply.</p><h4 id="alchemist-level-2">Alchemist: Level 2</h4><p>Once the Alchemist has been upgraded to level 2, brewed potions can be distilled. Characters distill a potion by returning it from their pool of items to the available craftable supply. The distilling character gains any one of the herb resources required to brew the potion. If the same potion has been revealed in multiple windows of the alchemy chart, the distilling character can choose one herb resource from any of those potion formulas. Potions that have not yet been revealed on the alchemy chart cannot be distilled.</p><h4 id="alchemist-level-3">Alchemist: Level 3</h4><p>Once the Alchemist has been upgraded to level 3, more powerful potions can be brewed by spending any three herb resources. These three-herb combinations each have their own window on the alchemy chart. All three-herb combinations brewed with two or more of the same herb resource create the same potion, which cannot be distilled.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">üîù</a>¬† ¬†<a name="page_67">67</a></strong></p><hr/>
