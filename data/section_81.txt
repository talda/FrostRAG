<h3 id="exhaustion">Exhaustion</h3><p>A  character can become exhausted in two ways:</p><ol type="A">
<li><strong>No Hit Points:</strong> If the character ever reaches zero on their red hit point dial.</li>
<li><strong>No Cards:</strong> If the character does not have at least two cards in their hand (to play) or at least two cards in their discard pile (to rest) at the start of a round. Becoming exhausted this way does not affect their current hit point value.</li>
</ol><p>When a character becomes exhausted, all of their ability cards, including any summons and other cards in their active area, are placed in their lost pile, and their figure is removed from the map. This can even occur in the middle of performing an ability.</p><p>Exhausted characters can no longer participate in the scenario in any way, so exhaustion should be avoided at all costs!</p><p>Exhaustion does not reduce the number of characters in the scenario. If all characters become exhausted during a scenario, the scenario is lost.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_39">39</a></strong></p><hr/>
