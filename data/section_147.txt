<h3 id="solo-mode">Solo Mode</h3><p>A single player can play solo by controlling two or more characters. Because playing solo reduces uncertainty and makes coordination easier, increase the difficulty by calculating the scenario level differently for solo mode. Take the average level of all characters in the scenario, then add 1 before dividing by 2 and rounding up. For example, on recommended difficulty with three level 4 characters, the scenario level would be ((4 + 4 + 4) รท 3 รท 2) = 2, but in solo mode it would be ((((4 + 4 + 4) รท 3) + 1) รท 2) = 3.</p>
