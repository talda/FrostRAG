<h3 id="conditions">Conditions</h3><p>A condition ability is a positive or negative targeted ability, depending on the specified condition, and causes the target of the ability to gain that condition.</p><p>When a monster gains a condition — except bless or curse — place the matching token on its stat sleeve in the section corresponding to the number on its standee. When a character gains a condition — except bless or curse — place the matching token on their character mat.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Bless and curse tokens are only used for tracking the effects of traps (see <a href="#page_14">p.14</a>). Once gained, a condition remains until the requirements for its removal are met. Neither positive nor negative conditions can be removed voluntarily. A figure cannot have multiple instances of the same condition; however, if a figure gains a condition they already have, the effect’s duration resets.</p>
</blockquote><p>If a figure gains a condition during their turn that is removed “at the end of the figure’s next turn,” the condition goes into effect immediately and applies until the end of their next turn. Conditions which are removed at the end of a figure’s turn are only removed after all other end-of-turn effects are resolved.</p><p>A condition effect can also be added to other abilities as an added effect, causing all targets of the ability to gain that condition after its main effect is resolved. If the ability is an attack, the target gains the condition even if the attack dealt no damage, but they do not gain the condition if the attack killed or exhausted them, or if they are immune.</p><h4 id="positive-conditions">Positive Conditions</h4><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> <img alt="Regenerate Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-regenerate-color-icon.png" title="Regenerate Icon" width="42"/> <strong>Regenerate:</strong> The figure performs “Heal 1, self” (see <a href="#page_29">p.29</a>) at the start of each of their turns, even if they have stun. Regenerate is removed when the figure suffers damage. If a figure has both regenerate and wound (see <a href="#page_29">p.29</a>), the regenerate effect is applied first, removing wound before it takes effect.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> <img alt="Ward Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-ward-color-icon.png" title="Ward Icon" width="42"/> <strong>Ward:</strong> The next time the figure suffers damage from any source, they instead suffer half that amount of damage (rounded down), and ward is then removed. If a figure that suffers damage has both ward and brittle (see <a href="#page_29">p.29</a>), they negate each other and are removed.</p>
</blockquote><p><img alt="Invisible Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-invisible-color-icon.png" title="Invisible Icon" width="42"/> <strong>Invisible:</strong> The figure cannot be focused on or targeted by any enemy, though non-targeted abilities remain unaffected. The figure and their allies can still interact with each other. Invisible is removed at the end of the figure’s next turn.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Enemies treat figures with invisible as if they were not there; they can move through figures with invisible but still cannot end their movement in the same hex.</p>
</blockquote><p><img alt="Strengthen Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-strengthen-color-icon.png" title="Strengthen Icon" width="42"/> <strong>Strengthen:</strong> The figure gains advantage on all of their attacks. Strengthen is removed at the end of the figure’s next turn.</p><p><img alt="Bless Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-bless-color-icon.png" title="Bless Icon" width="42"/> <strong>Bless:</strong> The figure must shuffle a bless card into their attack modifier deck. If the figure does not use an attack modifier deck, bless has no effect. When a bless card is drawn, it acts as a <img alt="2X Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-2x-icon.png" title="2X Icon"/> modifier and is returned to the supply once resolved, instead of placed in the discard pile. There are 10 bless cards, which can be added to any deck. If there are no bless cards available, bless has no effect.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_29">29</a></strong></p><hr/><h4 id="negative-conditions">Negative Conditions</h4><p><img alt="Wound Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-wound-color-icon.png" title="Wound Icon" width="42"/> <strong>Wound:</strong> The figure suffers 1 damage at the start of each of their turns. Wound is removed when the figure is healed.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> <img alt="Brittle Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-brittle-color-icon.png" title="Brittle Icon" width="42"/> <strong>Brittle:</strong> The next time the figure would suffer damage from any source, they instead suffer double that amount of damage, and brittle is then removed. Brittle is also removed if the figure is healed.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> <img alt="Bane Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-bane-color-icon.png" title="Bane Icon" width="42"/> <strong>Bane:</strong> The figure suffers 10 damage at the end of their next turn, and bane is then removed. Bane is also removed if the figure is healed.</p>
</blockquote><p><img alt="Poison Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-poison-color-icon.png" title="Poison Icon" width="42"/> <strong>Poison:</strong> All attacks targeting the figure gain “<strong>+1</strong> <img alt="Attack Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-attack-bw-icon.png" title="Attack Icon"/>.” Poison is removed when the figure is healed but, unlike wound/brittle/bane, poison prevents the heal from increasing the figure’s current hit point value.</p><p><img alt="Immobilize Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-immobilize-color-icon.png" title="Immobilize Icon" width="42"/> <strong>Immobilize:</strong> The figure cannot perform any move abilities. Immobilize is removed at the end of the figure’s next turn.</p><p><img alt="Disarm Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-disarm-color-icon.png" title="Disarm Icon" width="42"/> <strong>Disarm:</strong> The figure cannot perform any attack abilities. Disarm is removed at the end of the figure’s next turn.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> <img alt="Impair Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-impair-color-icon.png" title="Impair Icon" width="42"/> <strong>Impair:</strong> Impair can only be gained by characters. The character cannot use or trigger any items, but bonuses previously gained from items are still active. Impair is removed at the end of the character’s next turn.</p>
</blockquote><p><img alt="Stun Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-stun-color-icon.png" title="Stun Icon" width="42"/> <strong>Stun:</strong> The figure cannot perform any abilities or use or trigger any items, but bonuses previously gained are still active. Stun is removed at the end of the figure’s next turn. At the start of the round, stunned characters still must select two cards to play (or declare a long rest), but the cards will be discarded with no effect if stun is not removed by some other means before the end of their turn. Long resting still occurs normally for stunned characters.</p><p><img alt="Muddle Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-muddle-color-icon.png" title="Muddle Icon" width="42"/> <strong>Muddle:</strong> The figure gains disadvantage on all of their attacks. Muddle is removed at the end of the figure’s next turn.</p><p><img alt="Curse Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-curse-color-icon.png" title="Curse Icon" width="42"/> <strong>Curse:</strong> The figure must shuffle a curse card into their attack modifier deck. If the figure does not use an attack modifier deck, curse has no effect. When a curse card is drawn, it acts as a <img alt="Miss Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-miss-icon.png" title="Miss Icon"/> modifier and is returned to the supply once resolved, instead of placed in the discard pile. There are 10 curse cards with the <img alt="Star Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-star-icon.png" title="Star Icon"/> icon, which can only be added to character and ally decks, and 10 curse cards with the <img alt="Monster Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-monster-icon.png" title="Monster Icon"/> icon, which can only be added to the monster deck. If there are no applicable curse cards available, curse has no effect. Immunity to curse prevents a figure from adding a curse card to their deck, but does not prevent a drawn curse card from taking effect.</p>
