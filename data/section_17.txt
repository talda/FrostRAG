<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1><p>Your goal is to keep the outpost of Frosthaven safe from all threats. Your party of mercenaries will do this by venturing out into the wilderness in various scenarios. Once a scenario is completed, new scenarios become available, which progresses the campaign narrative. Between scenarios, your party will return to Frosthaven to resolve events, acquire new items and abilities, and interact with buildings.</p><p>The heart of the game lies in its characters, which you will create from the six starting character classes, though more will become available as the campaign progresses. The game can be played with two to four players, and each player will use a separate character. (See <a href="#page_69">p.69</a> for solo mode rules.) Each character class, indicated by a different icon, has a unique set of ability cards that determine how they play.</p>
