<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> When a monster ability card depicts an infusion or consumption, it triggers if at least one monster of the set performs an ability.</p>
</blockquote><p>An infusion occurs when the last monster of the set ends their turn, while a consumption occurs when the first monster of the set starts their turn and benefits every monster of the set.</p><p>If any monsters of the same set act later in the initiative order, because they were revealed or spawned, they do not gain the benefit of a previous consumption, but they can consume an element that was infused in the intervening time.</p><p>If a monster infuses or consumes a wild or mixed element, the party decides which element is infused or consumed.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_44">44</a></strong></p><hr/>
