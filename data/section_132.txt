<h3 id="sell-items">Sell Items</h3><p>Items from a characterâ€™s pool can be sold during the Downtime step. When a character gains another copy of an item they already own, they must sell it immediately. When a character sells a purchasable item, they gain gold equal to half its gold cost (rounded down). When a character sells a craftable item, they gain 2 gold for each resource or item required to craft it. Return items to the corresponding available supply when sold.</p>
