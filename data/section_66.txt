<h3 id="loot">Loot</h3><p><img alt="Loot Icon" src="icons/general/fh-loot-bw-icon.png" title="Loot Icon" width="42"/>  “<strong>Loot X</strong>” is an ability that allows a figure to loot all loot tokens and treasure tiles within range X, including any in their current hex. This ability is unaffected by the presence of figures or overlay tiles. If there are no loot tokens or treasure tiles within the specified range, the ability cannot be performed.</p><blockquote>

If the looting figure is a monster, nothing else happens. If the looting figure is a character, they draw one card from the loot deck (unless the loot deck is empty).</p>
<p>If the loot card provides a random item, the looting character checks off <img alt="Treasure Chest Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-treasure-chest-bw-icon.png" title="Treasure Chest Icon"/> <strong>(x1)</strong> in the scenario entry’s loot table, then draws one card from the random item deck and adds it to their pool of items. They may then use it normally for the remainder of the scenario, even if it puts them above the limit for that type of item. If the random item deck is empty, this card is considered a money card with three coins. If the loot card provides money or resources, the looting character does not gain them until the end of the scenario (see <a href="#page_47">p.47</a>).</p>
</blockquote><p>When a treasure tile is looted, it is removed from the map. Monsters cannot loot treasure tiles. If the looted treasure tile is a numbered treasure, reference the treasure’s number in the Treasure Index and apply the effect (see <a href="#page_78">p.78</a>). Only the looting character gains the reward, unless it is a random item blueprint or random scenario.</p><blockquote>
