<h3 id="lost-actions">Lost Actions</h3><p><img alt="Lost Icon" src="icons/general/fh-lost-black-card-color-icon.png" title="Lost Icon" width="42"/>  Lost actions can only be performed once. If an action has the lost icon, when any part of the action is performed, the card must be placed in the characterâ€™s lost pile, where it will remain until the end of the scenario (unless recovered).</p><p>If the lost action was used to perform an active bonus ability, the card is still considered lost and must be moved from the active area to the lost pile once the active bonus is no longer in effect.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Some lost actions have the <img alt="Unrecoverable Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-non-return-card-color-icon.png" title="Unrecoverable Icon"/> icon. If a character performs an action with this icon, when the card is placed in the lost pile, rotate it 180 degrees so that it is upside down. This card cannot be recovered by any means until the end of the scenario.</p>
