<h2 id="ordering-of-initiative">Ordering of Initiative</h2><p>After each character has selected two ability cards or declared a long rest, reveal the selected cards for each character who will not be long resting. Each character’s chosen initiative card should be directly on top of the other card, so that only one initiative value is visible. All cards can now be openly discussed.</p><p>In addition, reveal one monster ability card for each monster set that has at least one figure currently on the map. Note that several <strong>monster types</strong> (e.g., Black Imps, Forest Imps, or Snow Imps) may belong to the same <strong>monster set</strong> (e.g., Imps), in which case they would all use the same monster ability deck (e.g., the Imp deck).</p><p>Determine the initiative order by comparing the initiative values on all revealed monster ability cards (located in the upper left corner) and all characters’ initiative cards.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Take the initiative order tokens for all monster types and characters on the map and arrange them from <strong>lowest to highest</strong> (i.e., earliest to latest) initiative.</p>
</blockquote><p>Any character long resting has an initiative of 99. This indicates the turn order for this round.</p>
