<h3 id="bosses">Bosses</h3><p>Bosses are a special class of monster. They use a different type of stat card and a special boss ability deck.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Place boss standees in red bases to identify them.</p>
</blockquote><p>Bosses are not considered normal or elite, so they are not affected by abilities that target those ranks. In addition to providing stats, a boss’s stat card describes its special abilities, which are activated by its ability cards. A boss’s stats might refer to “C,” which represents the number of characters in the scenario.</p><p>If the special abilities of a boss are too complex to fit on its stat card, the scenario rules will provide more information.</p>
