<h3 id="revealing-and-spawning-monsters">Revealing and Spawning Monsters</h3><p>Other than when summoned, monsters can be added to the map in two different ways:</p><ol type="A">
<li><strong>Revealing Monsters:</strong> When the section book indicates that monsters are revealed in a new room, add them to the map immediately, along with any indicated overlay tiles or tokens, as you would when setting up a scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Spawning Monsters:</strong> If the scenario rules indicate that monsters spawn in specific locations at specific times, add them to the map when specified. If a specified location is not empty, place the monster in the closest empty hex instead.</li>
</ol><p>Unlike monsters that have been summoned, monsters that have been revealed or spawned act during the same round in which they were added to the map. If a newly added monster set does not have an ability card drawn for the current round, draw one now.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Check the initiative value for the sets of all added monsters. If their initiative value comes after the acting figure’s initiative value, their initiative order token should be in its normal position; they will act in normal initiative order. If their initiative value comes before the acting figure’s initiative value, move or insert their initiative order token after the acting figure’s token; they will act next. When multiple new monster sets would act next, order their tokens based on initiative values.</p>
</blockquote><p>When monsters are added to the map, if there are not enough standees of the right type, place as many monsters as possible, starting with elite monsters, in order of proximity to an enemy. Once the standees run out, do not place the remaining monsters. If there are not enough bases of the right color, place the remaining monsters without bases.</p>
