<h1 id="learning-the-rules">Learning the Rules</h1><p>With your characters created, it is time to tackle the rules. If you would prefer not to read the rulebook and instead watch a video, you can find one here:</p><p><a href="https://cephalofair.com/frosthaven">cephalofair.com/frosthaven</a></p><p>The rules are broken up into two main sections: rules for playing through a scenario and rules for what you can do between scenarios. To start with, you’ll need to familiarize yourself with the scenario rules, though you can skip over the following sections:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Road Events</strong>: These will not occur at the start of the first scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario Level</strong>: This will be set to “1” for the first few scenarios</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> If you are already experienced with the Gloomhaven system, you can look through the “Scenario Phase” section and read only the parts in blue (like this one), which isolate the scenario rules that are exclusive to Frosthaven. If you are only familiar with Jaws of the Lion, it is recommended that you read through the entire rulebook before you begin.</p>
</blockquote><p>Once you are familiar with the scenario rules, feel free to jump into your first scenario by following the instructions of “The Adventure Begins” section on <a href="#page_49">p.49</a>. If you are completely new to the Gloomhaven system, it is not only recommended that you read through the entire rulebook, but also that you start the game with scenario 0.</p><p>If you are ever unsure about something and need to find it again in the rulebook, there is an “Index” section on <a href="#page_80">p.80</a> to help with that as well as an “Important Reminders” section on <a href="#page_76">p.76</a> for commonly overlooked rules.</p><p>As with any game of this size and scope, there might be cases when the rules offer no definitive answer and multiple interpretations seem equally viable. Remember this universal rule: <strong>The party decides ambiguity.</strong> Just make whatever decision you’d like about how to resolve the situation. And if you need extra clarification for something, the official FAQ will be maintained at <a href="https://cephalofair.com/frosthaven">cephalofair.com/frosthaven</a>.</p><p>Lastly, you will find that some sections of the rulebook have been left blank. You will be directed to fill these blank sections with stickers describing new rules, as you open certain sealed envelopes, so don’t worry about them for now.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_7">7</a></strong></p><hr/>
