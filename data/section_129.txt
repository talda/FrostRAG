<h3 id="create-a-character">Create a Character</h3><p>After a player retires their previous character, or if they simply wish to try something new, they can create a new character during the Downtime step.</p><p>If their previous character has not yet been retired, the player can either set the character aside to play again later or abandon the character. When set aside, their personal quest, items, gold, and resources are all kept. When abandoned, their personal quest is shuffled back into the deck, their items are returned to the available supply, their resources are moved to the Frosthaven supply, and their gold is lost.</p><p>When creating a character, a player may choose any class without an active character. This includes classes that have already been played during the campaign, as long as all previous characters of the chosen class have been retired or abandoned (not merely set aside). As the campaign progresses, new classes will be unlocked.</p><h4 id="initial-benefits">Initial Benefits</h4><p>The new character draws two personal quests, choosing one to keep and shuffling the other back into the deck. It is possible for the personal quest deck to get depleted. When this happens, any new characters created during the campaign do not receive personal quests and therefore cannot ever be retired. Players can still set aside or abandon such characters whenever they wish, however.</p><p>The new character starts with (10 × P + 20) gold, where “P” is the current prosperity level. This starting gold must be spent immediately on items in the available purchasable supply. Any unspent remainder is lost.</p><p>The new character gains a number of perk marks equal to the number of characters previously retired by that player during the campaign.</p><h4 id="prosperity-leveling">Prosperity Leveling</h4><p>Since a new character always starts at level 1, they may immediately level up without meeting the experience requirement, even multiple times, as long as their level does not exceed half the current prosperity level (rounded up). After they level up, set their experience total to match the experience requirement of their new level.</p>
