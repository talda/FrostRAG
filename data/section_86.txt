<h3 id="focus">Focus</h3><p>At the start of its turn, a monster finds a focus. This focus is <strong>the enemy it can perform its attack on using the fewest movement points.</strong></p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Determining the shortest possible path takes into consideration the effects of difficult terrain and icy terrain.</p>
</blockquote><p>For a melee attack, the monster identifies the shortest possible path to a hex from which it can perform the melee attack. For a ranged attack, the monster identifies the shortest possible path to a hex from which it can perform the ranged attack within the specified range. If the monster cannot attack on its turn, either because it does not have an attack ability or because it has disarm, it focuses as if for a single-target melee attack.</p><p>If the shortest possible path would bring the monster within range of multiple enemies, it focuses on the one who is closest by range to its current hex. If those enemies are all equally close, it focuses on the one who acts earliest in the initiative order.</p><h4 id="additional-foci">Additional Foci</h4><p>If a monster‚Äôs attack ability allows it to attack multiple targets, it first finds a primary focus, then finds additional foci for the extra attacks. The monster does this by identifying the shortest possible path to a hex from which it can attack its primary focus and as many additional targets as the attack ability allows during its current turn.</p><h4 id="path-priority">Path Priority</h4><p>Monsters always prioritize a path that triggers the fewest negative hexes, like traps and hazardous terrain, even when that means not maximizing targets. Monsters only trigger negative hexes when there is no other viable path to attack an enemy. For example, if a monster could attack by moving two hexes and springing a trap on the way, or by moving 10 hexes and avoiding the trap, it would take the longer path.</p><p>It does not matter whether the monster can actually reach the end of the path on its current turn. As long as there is a path to reach a hex from which to attack an enemy, the monster can focus on that enemy. Focus does not require line-of-sight.</p><h4 id="no-focus">No Focus</h4><p>It is possible that a monster is unable to find a focus if it cannot reach a valid hex, given infinite movement, from which it can perform its attack. In such cases, the monster does not move or attack but still performs any other abilities listed on its ability card.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">üîù</a>¬† ¬†<a name="page_42">42</a></strong></p><hr/>
