<h3 id="craft-items">Craft Items</h3><p>Non-potion items can be crafted by interacting with the Craftsman building. Characters craft an item by spending the required resources or items. When paying crafting costs, material resources cannot be taken from the Frosthaven supply, but herb resources can. The crafting character gains one copy of the crafted item.</p><p>At the start of the campaign, only items 001–010 are available to be crafted. As the Craftsman gets upgraded and as the party discovers new item blueprints, more items will be added to the available craftable supply. Any item in the available craftable supply can be crafted.</p><p>When an item is required to craft another item, if all copies of the required item are owned by other members of the party, the crafting character may spend the gold, resources, or items listed as the required item’s cost in place of spending the item itself.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_66">66</a></strong></p><hr/>
