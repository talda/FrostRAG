<h3 id="resting">Resting</h3><p>Resting is the main way that a character can retrieve cards from their discard pile. They have two options when they rest: a short rest or a long rest. In both cases, the rest can only be performed if the character has at least two cards in their discard pile. Resting always results in losing one card from their discard pile.</p><p>During the End of Round step (see <a href="#page_46">p.46</a>), a character may perform a <strong>short rest</strong>. When a character short rests, they lose one random card from their discard pile and return the remaining cards to their hand. If they would like to keep the card that was lost, they can suffer 1 damage to lose a different random card instead, but this can only be done once per short rest.</p><p>During the Card Selection step (see <a href="#page_18">p.18</a>), a character may declare a <strong>long rest</strong>. This constitutes their entire turn for the round, instead of playing two cards, and it is performed on initiative 99. When a character long rests, they follow these steps:</p><ol>
<li>Lose one card of their choice from their discard pile and return the remaining cards to their hand (mandatory).</li>
<li>Perform “Heal 2, self “ (optional).</li>
<li>Recover all of their spent items (optional).Items can be used during the same turn in which they are recovered.</li>
</ol>
