<h3 id="permanent-death">Permanent Death</h3><p>With this variant, the specter of death looms large for parties who want higher stakes. When a character drops to zero hit points, they die instead of becoming exhausted. Characters can still become exhausted if unable to play two cards or perform a long rest, but they survive and can still participate in future scenarios, even if the current scenario is lost.</p><p>When a character dies, they are removed from the campaign at the end of the current scenario. Their personal quest is shuffled back into the deck. Their character materials are put back in the corresponding tuck boxes. Their items are returned to the available supply, their resources are moved to the Frosthaven supply, and their gold is lost. The player whose character died must create a new character during the Downtime step of the next Outpost Phase (or, if the next scenario is force-linked, immediately before the scenario begins).</p><p>When a character becomes exhausted, all normal exhaustion effects still occur, except their figure now remains on the map and can still be targeted by monster attacks and other abilities. Exhausted characters still cannot act in any way, and they are considered to have initiative 99 for the purpose of focusing.</p>
