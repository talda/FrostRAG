<h3 id="attack">Attack</h3><p>“<strong>Attack X</strong>” is a negative targeted ability that allows a figure to deal a base amount of X damage to an enemy within the specified range.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> An attack with no specified range value is considered a melee attack with range 1, capable of targeting adjacent enemies only, unless otherwise stated. For example, if an effect provides “<strong>+ Y</strong> <img alt="Range Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-range-bw-icon.png" title="Range Icon"/>” to an attack, it would give the attack with no specified range value”<img alt="Range Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-range-bw-icon.png" title="Range Icon"/> <strong>1 + Y</strong>” and make it a ranged attack.</p>
</blockquote><p>An <strong>attack</strong> is a single attack performed against one target, an <strong>attack ability</strong> is an ability that consists of one or more separate attacks, and an <strong>attack action</strong> is any action that contains at least one attack ability.</p><h4 id="attack-modification-order">Attack Modification Order</h4><p>When an attack is performed, the base attack value written on the card can be modified in four different ways in the following order:</p><ol>
<li>All applicable attack bonuses and penalties, such as “<strong>± <img alt="Attack Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-attack-bw-icon.png" title="Attack Icon"/></strong>” effects, are applied. If there are multiple bonuses or penalties, the party chooses the order in which they are applied.</li>
<li>An attack modifier card is drawn from the attacker’s deck and applied.</li>
<li>The target’s shield bonus is applied (see <a href="#page_31">p.31</a>).</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Ward and brittle are applied (see <a href="#page_28">p.28</a>). If the target has both conditions, they negate each other and are removed.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol><p>Once all modifications have been applied, the target suffers the resulting amount of damage. If the target has any abilities or effects which can negate a source of damage, including losing cards to negate damage (see <a href="#page_38">p.38</a>), they may apply them now.</p><p>These steps are repeated for each individual target of the attack ability, which means it is possible for different targets to suffer different amounts of damage from the same attack ability.</p><h4 id="attack-modifier-cards">Attack Modifier Cards</h4><p>Any time an attack ability is performed, <strong>a separate attack modifier card is drawn for each individual target of the attack ability.</strong> The modifier shown on the card is then applied to the attack, possibly reducing or increasing its value. Once the effects of a drawn modifier card have been applied, it is placed in its discard pile.</p><p>Attack modifier cards are only drawn for attacks. They are not used for any other type of effect that deals damage.</p><p>Characters each have their own deck, while all monsters share a single deck.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> If a scenario includes scenario allies, they all use the separate ally deck.</p>
</blockquote><p>Characters, monsters, and allies start with a standard deck of six <img alt="0 Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-plus-0-bw-icon.png" title="0 Icon"/>, five <img alt="-1 Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-minus-1-color-icon.png" title="-1 Icon"/>, five <img alt="+1 Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-plus-1-color-icon.png" title="+1 Icon"/>, one <img alt="-2 Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-minus-2-color-icon.png" title="-2 Icon"/>, one <img alt="+2 Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-plus-2-color-icon.png" title="+2 Icon"/>, one <img alt="Miss Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-miss-icon.png" title="Miss Icon"/>, and one <img alt="2X Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-2x-icon.png" title="2X Icon"/>, but characters can customize their decks over time through perks (see <a href="#page_63">p.63</a>), allowing for other diverse effects.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_26">26</a></strong></p><hr/><p>An attack modifier card can have the following:</p><ol type="A">
<li><strong>Modifier Value:</strong> This value modifies the attack value. The <img alt="Miss Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-miss-icon.png" title="Miss Icon"/> modifier reduces the final attack value to zero. The <img alt="2X Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-2x-icon.png" title="2X Icon"/> modifier doubles the current attack value.</li>
<li><strong>Added Effects:</strong> Some modifiers have elemental infusions (see <a href="#page_23">p.23</a>), conditions (see <a href="#page_28">p.28</a>), or other added effects. When activated, these added effects function exactly as if written on the attack ability.</li>
<li><strong>Rolling Icon:</strong> When a rolling modifier <img alt="Rolling Modifier Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-rolling-color-icon.png" title="Rolling Modifier Icon"/> is drawn, the attacker draws additional modifiers, one at a time, until a non-rolling modifier is drawn. The drawn modifiers can then be applied in any order.</li>
<li><strong>Bless / Curse Border:</strong> Bless and curse cards are returned to the supply once resolved, instead of placed in the discard pile. Every curse card has a <img alt="Star Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-star-icon.png" title="Star Icon"/> or <img alt="Monster Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-monster-icon.png" title="Monster Icon"/> icon to indicate whether it is used in character and ally decks or the monster deck.</li>
<li><strong>Shuffle Icon:</strong> At the end of the round in which a modifier with the shuffle icon <img alt="Shuffle Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-shuffle-icon.png" title="Shuffle Icon"/> is drawn, the discard pile is shuffled back into the deck. This shuffle is performed immediately if the deck is empty when a modifier must be drawn.</li>
<li><strong>Sorting Icon:</strong> All standard modifiers have a <img alt="Player 1 Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-player-1-icon.png" title="Player 1 Icon"/>, <img alt="Player 2 Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-player-2-icon.png" title="Player 2 Icon"/>, <img alt="Player 3 Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-player-3-icon.png" title="Player 3 Icon"/>, <img alt="Player 4 Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-player-4-icon.png" title="Player 4 Icon"/>, <img alt="Ally Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-ally-icon.png" title="Ally Icon"/>, or <img alt="Monster Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-monster-icon.png" title="Monster Icon"/> icon for easy sorting. All modifiers added to a character deck through perks (see <a href="#page_63">p.63</a>) have their class icon. All modifiers added to a deck by another effect have the <img alt="Star Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-star-icon.png" title="Star Icon"/> icon.</li>
</ol><h4 id="attack-effects">Attack Effects</h4><p>An attack effect is an effect attached to an attack. These effects are applied either during damage resolution or after the attack resolves. If applied after the attack resolves, the attack effect is still applied even if the attack deals no damage (including due to a <img alt="Miss Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-miss-icon.png" title="Miss Icon"/> card).</p><p>The attacker must choose whether to apply any attack effects before they draw an attack modifier card. All attack effects except “<strong>+X</strong> <img alt="Target Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-target-bw-icon.png" title="Target Icon"/>” are applied before any retaliate bonus (see <a href="#page_31">p.31</a>). The “<strong>+X</strong> <img alt="Target Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-target-bw-icon.png" title="Target Icon"/>” effect allows the attacker to perform additional attacks, and each attack must be resolved completely before another can be performed.</p><table>

</table><p>Some attacks have abilities (e.g., heal abilities) that aren’t attack effects but are still attached to the attack. These abilities are performed after the attack is resolved completely (including after any retaliate bonus).</p><p>Some modifiers have added effects, besides modifying the attack value, and <strong>an attacking character can always choose</strong> whether to apply those effects after the modifier is drawn.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> If another figure uses a character’s deck, the character controls the added effects of the modifier even though the attacking figure applies them.</p>
</blockquote><p>Modifiers that affect a character’s class-specific resources (e.g., the Blinkblade’s time tokens) or abilities (e.g., the Drifter’s use slot tokens) are always applied to that character, no matter who draws the modifier.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_27">27</a></strong></p><hr/><h4 id="advantage-and-disadvantage">Advantage and Disadvantage</h4><p>Some effects cause an attack to gain advantage or disadvantage. With <strong>advantage</strong>, the attacker draws two modifiers and uses one of them.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> A monster always uses the better one, but a character may use either one. With <strong>disadvantage</strong>, the attacker draws two modifiers and always uses the worse one.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> If the first draw with advantage or disadvantage is a rolling modifier <img alt="Rolling Modifier Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-rolling-color-icon.png" title="Rolling Modifier Icon"/>, the attacker draws additional modifiers, one at a time, until a non-rolling modifier is drawn. <strong>They then draw one more modifier and ignore any rolling icon on it.</strong></p>
<p>The first non-rolling modifier and the one after it are compared. If the attack has advantage, the attacker uses all initial rolling modifiers and whichever of the last two modifiers they choose. If the attack has disadvantage, the attacker ignores all initial rolling modifiers and uses whichever of the last two modifiers is worse.</p>
<p>If the first draw with advantage or disadvantage is not a rolling modifier, but the second draw is, the rolling icon on the second modifier is still ignored.</p>
</blockquote><p>When there is ambiguity about which modifier is worse, the attacker must use the one drawn first. Ambiguity occurs when comparing the non-numeric effects of some modifiers (e.g., elemental infusions or negative conditions). Any non-numeric effect is considered to have a positive but undefined value.</p><p>An attack cannot gain multiple instances of advantage or disadvantage. If an attack has both advantage and disadvantage, it is considered to have neither.</p><p><strong>Any ranged attack on an adjacent enemy automatically gains disadvantage.</strong></p><h4 id="pierce">Pierce</h4><p><img alt="Pierce Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-pierce-color-icon.png" title="Pierce Icon" width="42"/> “<strong>Pierce X</strong>” is an added effect that reduces the target’s shield bonus (see <a href="#page_31">p.31</a>) by X.
