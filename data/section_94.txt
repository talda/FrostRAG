<h3 id="monster-damage-and-death">Monster Damage and Death</h3><p>When a monster suffers damage, place damage tokens on its stat sleeve in the section corresponding to its standee number. As soon as the total amount of damage suffered by a monster is equal to or greater than its maximum hit point value, it dies.</p><p>When a monster dies, remove its standee from the map, clear all tokens from its section of the stat sleeve, and</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> place a loot token in the hex where it died, even if it was summoned or spawned, unless it was a scenario ally.</p>
</blockquote><p>No attack effects can be applied to a monster after it dies. If a monster dies while performing one of its own abilities, it cannot perform any other abilities.</p><h4 id="kill-credit">Kill Credit</h4><p>Certain battle goals, personal quests, and abilities require characters to track their kills. Summons pass credit for their kills to their summoner.</p><p>If a monster dies from damage caused by an attack, retaliate bonus, or suffer damage ability, the figure who caused the damage gets credit for the kill. If a monster dies from damage caused by a negative hex due to forced movement, the figure who caused the forced movement gets credit for the kill.</p><p>If a monster dies from damage caused by wound, bane, another monster, or a negative hex due to voluntary movement, no kill credit is given.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_46">46</a></strong></p><hr/>
