<h3 id="active-bonuses">Active Bonuses</h3><p>An active bonus ability is any ability that provides an active bonus to a figure or their allies. When a character performs an active bonus ability, the card is placed in their active area to track the bonus. Cards in a character’s active area are not considered to be in their hand.</p><p>Active bonus abilities have icons to indicate the duration of the bonuses they provide. When a bonus expires, even if the action has other active bonus abilities, the card is removed from the character’s active area and placed in their discard pile or lost pile, depending on whether the action has a lost icon (see <a href="#page_38">p.38</a>).</p><p><img alt="Round Bonus Icon" src="icons/general/fh-round-bonus-color-icon.png" title="Round Bonus Icon" width="42"/>  Round Bonuses: These bonuses activate when the ability is performed and expire at the end of the round.</p><p><img alt="Persistent Bonus Icon" src="icons/general/fh-persistent-bonus-color-icon.png" title="Persistent Bonus Icon" width="42"/>  Persistent Bonuses: These bonuses activate when the ability is performed and expire when the specified removal condition has been fulfilled.</p><p>If the bonus has limited uses, these are tracked by a series of use slots. When the card is placed in the active area, a character token is added to the first slot. Each time the bonus is triggered, the token advances by one slot, even if no benefit is gained. When the token passes an experience icon <img alt="Experience Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-xp-bw-icon.png" title="Experience Icon"/>, the character gains that much experience (see <a href="#page_37">p.37</a>). When the token leaves the last slot, the bonus expires. If no removal condition is specified, the bonus expires at the end of the scenario. If the bonus lasts for a limited number of rounds or turns, the round or turn in which it is activated does not count.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> A character may voluntarily remove a card with a persistent bonus (but not a round bonus) from their active area before the bonus expires, but doing so removes the bonus. This can be done at any time except during another ability.</p>
</blockquote><p>Actions with active bonus abilities might also have other abilities, but these other abilities are only performed when the card is played.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_31">31</a></strong></p><hr/><p>There is a wide variety of active bonus abilities. While these abilities are usually defined by text, there are three common ones to go over.</p><h4 id="shield">Shield</h4><p><img alt="Shield Icon" src="icons/general/fh-shield-bw-icon.png" title="Shield Icon" width="42"/>  “<strong>Shield X</strong>” is a positive ability that gives the acting figure a shield bonus of X. This reduces the attack value of an incoming attack by X. The shield bonus is only applied after all attack bonuses or penalties and modifiers have been applied. Multiple shield bonuses stack with one another as a single reduction in attack value. <strong>A shield bonus does not apply to sources of damage that are not attacks.</strong></p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> A shield ability always applies to the acting figure.</p>
</blockquote><h4 id="retaliate">Retaliate</h4><p><img alt="Retaliate Icon" src="icons/general/fh-retaliate-bw-icon.png" title="Retaliate Icon" width="42"/>  “<strong>Retaliate X</strong>” is a positive ability that gives the acting figure a retaliate bonus of X. This deals X damage to any figure who attacks them, if they are within the specified range after all attack effects are resolved (including push or pull). If no range is specified, the bonus is only applied to adjacent attackers. This bonus is triggered by each attack and occurs after the attack is resolved. A retaliate bonus is not an attack or targeted effect, therefore the damage cannot be reduced by a shield bonus. If a retaliating figure is killed or exhausted by an attack, the retaliate bonus does not occur. Multiple retaliate bonuses stack with one another as a single source of damage, but each retaliate bonus is only applied within its specified range.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> A retaliate ability always applies to the acting figure.</p>
</blockquote><h4 id="summon">Summon</h4><p>Summon is a positive ability that adds other allied figures to the map. These figures, known as “summons,” must be placed in different empty hexes adjacent to the summoner. If there is no adjacent hex available, the figure is not summoned.</p><p>A character summon is considered a persistent bonus, and their card is placed in the summoner’s active area. When the summon’s hit point value is reduced to zero, the summon is removed from the map. The summoner may voluntarily remove the summon from the map at any time except during another ability. The card is then placed in the summoner’s discard pile or lost pile, depending on whether the action has a lost icon (see <a href="#page_38">p.38</a>).</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Each character summon has a corresponding standee, found in the summoner’s tuck box, that is used to represent them on the map, using a blue standee base.</p>
</blockquote><p>When a character becomes exhausted, all of their summons are removed from the map.</p><p>Character summons have stats for their hit point, attack, move, and range values, along with any special traits listed on their ability cards. If a summon’s attack or move value is “–”, then they do not perform that ability unless granted an ability with a base value. If a summon’s range value is “–”, then they do not perform ranged attacks unless granted that ability (see <a href="#page_33">p.33</a>).</p><p>A character summon’s turn in the initiative order is always directly before their summoner and is separate from the summoner’s turn. Summons are not controlled by their summoner, but instead obey automated monster rules, performing “<img alt="Move Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-move-bw-icon.png" title="Move Icon"/><strong>+0</strong>, <img alt="Attack Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-attack-bw-icon.png" title="Attack Icon"/><strong>+0</strong>” (see <a href="#page_41">p.41</a>). A summon uses their summoner’s attack modifier deck when attacking.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> If a character summon cannot find a focus, the summoner may choose for the summon to move toward them instead.</p>
</blockquote><p>A character can have multiple summons on the map at once. Each new summon’s card is placed to the right of the previous summon’s card in the summoner’s active area. In such cases, the summons will act in that order (from left to right). If there are multiple copies of the same summon on the map at once, the order in which they were summoned determines their acting order, which can be tracked using their standee numbers.</p><p><strong>Summons never take a turn during the round in which they are summoned.</strong></p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_32">32</a></strong></p><hr/>
