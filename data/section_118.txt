<h3 id="defense-checks">Defense Checks</h3><p>When an attack occurs, the party must perform a defense check for each building targeted by the attack. For each defense check, draw a card from the town guard deck and add its bonus to Frosthaven’s total defense value (along with any modifiers from the event).</p><p>For any defense check, as long as the Barracks is not wrecked, the party can lose any number of soldiers before drawing to give the check advantage and reduce the attack value, based on the level of the Barracks and the number of soldiers lost. The defense check gains disadvantage if the Barracks is wrecked.</p><p>If the result meets or exceeds the attack value, the defense check succeeds and the building is defended. The defense check automatically succeeds when the “success” card is drawn and applied. Otherwise, the defense check fails and the building is damaged. For some attack events, the building is wrecked instead. The building is automatically wrecked when the “wrecked” card is drawn and applied.</p><p>Do not resolve any effects of buildings being damaged or wrecked during the attack until the entire attack event has fully resolved. Reshuffle the town guard deck after the attack and as needed during the attack if the deck is depleted.</p>
