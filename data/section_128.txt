<h3 id="retire-a-character">Retire a Character</h3><p>If a character has fulfilled the requirements of their personal quest, they must retire during the Downtime step, though they can perform all other downtime activities they would like to before doing so. Having achieved what they set out to do, they are no longer motivated to explore the monster-filled wilderness. Retired characters can no longer participate in the campaign with the rest of the party.</p><p>When a character retires, the completion of their personal quest gains the party 2 prosperity and unlocks the building envelope specified on the personal quest card. If a specified envelope is already unlocked, the alternate envelope is unlocked instead. If both envelopes are already unlocked, the party instead gains a random scenario (or 1 inspiration if that deck is depleted) and a random item blueprint (or 1 inspiration if that deck is depleted).</p><p>The retiring character may spend 15 inspiration once to draw two additional personal quests and choose one to complete immediately, without fulfilling its requirements, and shuffle the other back into the deck. This gains the party 2 more prosperity and unlocks another building envelope. The effects of completing two personal quests upon retirement are resolved simultaneously, so that they do not influence each other.</p><p>A personal quest card has the following:</p><ol type="A">
<li><strong>Title:</strong> A thematic title for the quest.</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> A short description of the quest.</li>
<li><strong>Requirements:</strong> The specific requirements for completing the quest.</li>
<li><strong>Rewards:</strong> The building envelope unlocked by completing the quest.</li>
</ol><h4 id="after-retirement">After Retirement</h4><p>For each class, the first time a character of that class retires during the campaign, flip their character mat over and find the section number found near the bottom on the back side. After the retiring character has resolved the completion of their personal quest, read the indicated section from the section book.</p><p>As characters retire, record them in the retirement table on the campaign sheet, noting the character name, player name, and the other indicated information. When a new character is created, they gain one perk mark for each character previously retired by that player. If a single player is playing solo with multiple characters (see <a href="#page_69">p.69</a>), count each character‚Äôs lineage separately for this purpose.</p><p>After a character retires, their personal quest is removed from the game, as well as any additional personal quest they completed upon retirement. Their character materials are put back in the corresponding tuck boxes. Their items are returned to the available supply, their resources are moved to the Frosthaven supply, and their gold is lost.</p><p>Retirement can only be done during the Downtime step. Characters cannot retire during a scenario or even between scenarios if the party does not return to Frosthaven for an Outpost Phase (e.g., when the party attempts a linked scenario).</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">üîù</a>¬† ¬†<a name="page_65">65</a></strong></p><hr/>
