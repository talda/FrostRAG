<h3 id="carpenter">Carpenter</h3><p>Once the Carpenter has been built, the cost to build, upgrade, or rebuild any building is reduced by any one material resource. Once the Carpenter has been upgraded to level 2, the party only loses 1 morale (not 2) if they wish to build or upgrade a second building during the Construction step. If the Carpenter is wrecked, these bonuses do not apply.</p>
