A teleport ability is not considered a move ability, and teleporting is not considered movement. Teleportation is not affected by anything, even walls, in the hexes between. A figure can only teleport to a valid hex, and any effects of entering that hex still trigger normally, unless otherwise stated. A figure cannot teleport into an unrevealed room, but they can teleport to a hex with a closed door, opening the door as a result</p>
