<h2 id="scenario-flowchart">Scenario Flowchart</h2><p>The scenario flowchart shows how the scenarios are connected to each other. When a scenario is unlocked, open and tear off the corresponding window of the flowchart. On the back of the window will be a sticker, which should be affixed to the map board at the specified coordinates (or, in the case of “FR,” at the numbered position in the lower half of the map).</p><p>The revealed section of the flowchart will have information about the scenario, including its name, number, coordinates, geographic location, and any requirements. See the icon key on the back of the flowchart for more details.</p><p>The colored bar beneath the name of each scenario indicates which scenario chain it is part of, and between the various windows on the flowchart are arrows that show how the scenarios are connected to each other. These make it easier to track your path through the campaign.</p><p>During the campaign, some unlocked scenarios might become locked out, which means they are no longer available. When this happens, affix a red lockout sticker <img alt="Lockout Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-locked-out-color-icon.png" title="Lockout Icon"/> to the corresponding section of the flowchart.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_52">52</a></strong></p><hr/>
