<h3 id="casual-mode">Casual Mode</h3><p>In casual mode, the party can play any unlocked scenario, regardless of its requirements. When a scenario is played in casual mode, all campaign effects are ignored. No event is resolved, time does not pass, and the party does not gain any experience, loot, treasures, checkmarks, personal quest progress, rewards, unlockables, etc. The outcome of the scenario has no impact on the campaign. However, completed scenarios can be replayed as part of the campaign (i.e., not in casual mode) as long as the party still meets their requirements.</p>
