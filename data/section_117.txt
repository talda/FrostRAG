<h3 id="attack-events">Attack Events</h3><p>Attack events are special outpost events that require the party to defend Frosthaven from attack. During these attacks, buildings will be targeted and potentially damaged or even wrecked. The frequency of attacks is significantly higher in winter than in summer.</p><p>The attack is depicted on the back of the event card, below any outcomes from the choice presented on the front of the event card. These outcomes often modify the attack in some way. The back of the card contains the following:</p><ol type="A">
<li><strong>Attack Value:</strong> This indicates the value that must be met or exceeded on a defense check to defend a targeted building.</li>
<li><strong>Target Value:</strong> This indicates the total number of buildings targeted by the attack. The party must perform a separate defense check for each targeted building.</li>
<li><strong>Target Priority:</strong> This indicates which non-wrecked buildings are targeted by the attack, and in what order, based on their reference numbers. If the attack has no target priority, the party decides. Each building can only be targeted once, even if the number of buildings within the target priority is lower than the target value.</li>
