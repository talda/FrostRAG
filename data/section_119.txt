<h3 id="damaged-buildings">Damaged Buildings</h3><p><img alt="Building Repair Icon" src="icons/general/fh-building-repair-bw-icon.png" title="Building Repair Icon" width="42"/>  When a building is damaged, the party must immediately pay the repair cost shown on its building card. This cost can be paid with material resources of any type from the Frosthaven supply or the charactersâ€™ personal supplies, in any combination. If the party cannot or does not want to pay this cost, they lose 1 morale instead.</p>
