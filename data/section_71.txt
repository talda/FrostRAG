<h2 id="character-turns">Character Turns</h2><p>On a character’s turn, unless performing a long rest (see <a href="#page_38">p.38</a>), they will perform the top action of one of their played ability cards and the bottom action of the other. They cannot perform two top actions or two bottom actions. They can perform either action first; which card was selected for their initiative no longer matters.</p><p>Once played, ability cards can be placed around the sides of the character mat as shown here: discarded ability cards to the left, lost ability cards to the right, and active ability cards above the character mat. Cards in the character’s hand must be kept separate.</p>
