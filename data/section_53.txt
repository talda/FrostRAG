<h3 id="actions-and-abilities-overview">Actions and Abilities Overview</h3><h4 id="actions">Actions</h4><p>An <strong>action</strong> is a set of one or more abilities, which are detailed on one half of an ability card.</p><p>Characters will normally perform two actions on their turn: the top action of one of their played ability cards and the bottom action of the other. An entire half of a character ability card is considered a single action.</p><p>Monsters will perform one action on their turn. An entire monster ability card is considered a single action.</p><p>An action can be referred to by any of its abilities. For example, if an action contains a “<img alt="Move Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-move-bw-icon.png" title="Move Icon"/> <strong>2</strong>” ability and a “<img alt="Loot Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-loot-bw-icon.png" title="Loot Icon"/> <strong>2</strong>” ability, it can be referred to as both a move action and a loot action.</p><h4 id="abilities">Abilities</h4><p>An <strong>ability</strong> is any grouping of text and/or icons, often found on an ability card, that a figure can perform to interact with the map, themselves, or other figures.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> If an action consists of multiple abilities, these will be separated from each other by ability lines.</p>
</blockquote><p>Abilities in an action are always performed in the order they are written. Figures cannot perform new abilities while resolving a different ability, with the exception of abilities from attack modifier cards.</p><p>Character abilities can be skipped, unless they are mandatory (see <a href="#page_37">p.37</a>).</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_21">21</a></strong></p><hr/>
