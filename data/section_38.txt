<h3 id="boat-events">Boat Events</h3><p>A boat event is a small thematic interaction in the Biting Sea. When you use the boat upgrade to travel to a scenario on the sea, signified by the boat icon <img alt="Boat Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/outpost/fh-boat-bw-icon.png" title="Boat Icon"/> in the scenario book, draw a boat event <strong>instead of a road event.</strong> These are resolved in the same manner as road events. There is only one boat event deck; boat events are not split into summer and winter.</p>
