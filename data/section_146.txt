<h3 id="reduced-randomness">Reduced Randomness</h3><p>With this variant, parties who want less randomness can reduce the range of outcomes caused by attack modifier cards. Treat all <img alt="Miss Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-miss-icon.png" title="Miss Icon"/> and <img alt="Curse Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-curse-color-icon.png" title="Curse Icon"/> cards as <img alt="-2 Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-minus-2-color-icon.png" title="-2 Icon"/> cards instead, and treat all <img alt="2X Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-2x-icon.png" title="2X Icon"/> and <img alt="Bless icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-bless-color-icon.png" title="Bless icon"/> cards as <img alt="+2 Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-plus-2-color-icon.png" title="+2 Icon"/> cards instead. Even though these cards no longer have the same modifiers, the effect of the shuffle icon still applies. Any item effects or other game effects that refer to <img alt="Miss Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-miss-icon.png" title="Miss Icon"/> or <img alt="2X Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-2x-icon.png" title="2X Icon"/> cards are unaffected.</p>
