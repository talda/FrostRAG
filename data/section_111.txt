<h2 id="unlocking-new-buildings">Unlocking New Buildings</h2><p>New buildings are unlocked through character retirement (see <a href="#page_64">p.64</a>). Each new building has a corresponding sealed envelope, labeled with a two-digit number.</p><p>When a building is unlocked, you are free to open its envelope and inspect the contents. Shuffle any personal quests from the envelope into the personal quest deck. Take the “L0” sticker from the envelope and affix it to the lower half of the map board at the numbered position, matching up the artwork. <strong>The unlocked building must still be built before the party can interact with it.</strong></p><p>Unlocked buildings often introduce new rules. Locate any rules stickers specified beneath the flap of the envelope and affix them to the pages of this rulebook in the corresponding sections, matching up the numbers. All building cards and other materials should be stored in the envelope until needed.</p>
