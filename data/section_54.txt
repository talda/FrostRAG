<h3 id="important-ability-concepts">Important Ability Concepts</h3><h4 id="line-of-sight">Line-of-Sight</h4><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> When any figure or hex is targeted by any ability, the acting figure must have a clear <strong>line‑of‑sight</strong> to the target in order to perform the ability. Line-of-sight is established if a line can be drawn from any part of the acting figure’s hex to any part of the target hex without touching a wall line.</p>
</blockquote><p>Only walls and closed doors block line-of-sight. Non-targeted abilities are not affected by line-of-sight. If an ability allows a figure to perform it as if occupying a different hex, draw the line from that hex.</p><h4 id="target">Target</h4><p><img alt="Target Icon" src="icons/general/fh-target-bw-icon.png" title="Target Icon" width="42"/>  Abilities accompanied by “<strong>Target X</strong>” allow the acting figure to target up to X different figures within the ability’s range. Targeting and range restrictions, as well as additional effects of the ability, apply to all targets. It is not possible to target the same figure multiple times with the same ability, unless otherwise stated.</p><p>If no target is specified on a targeted ability, the target value is 1, which means it only targets a single figure. For example, if an effect provides “<strong>+1</strong> <img alt="Target Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-target-bw-icon.png" title="Target Icon"/>,” it would give an ability with no specified target value “<img alt="Target Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-target-bw-icon.png" title="Target Icon"/> <strong>2</strong>.”</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Attack (<a href="#page_25">p.25</a>), conditions (<a href="#page_28">p.28</a>), heal (<a href="#page_29">p.29</a>), forced movement (<a href="#page_32">p.32</a>), commanding figures (<a href="#page_33">p.33</a>), and manipulating tiles (<a href="#page_33">p.33</a>) are the only targeted abilities. Targeted abilities cannot be performed if there is no valid target.</p>
</blockquote><h4 id="allies-enemies-and-self">Allies, Enemies, and Self</h4><p>Characters are allies to other characters, monsters are allies to other monsters, and characters and monsters are enemies to each other. <strong>Figures are not their own allies.</strong></p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> In general, negative abilities can only target enemies, and positive abilities can only target allies or the acting figure themselves. Some abilities have specific targeting information that contradicts this rule. An ability specifying its targets as “all” follows these restrictions, but an ability specifying its targets as “all figures” targets both allies and enemies.</p>
</blockquote><p>If any ability specifies its target as “self,” the effect can only be applied to the acting figure.</p><h4 id="range">Range</h4><p><img alt="Range Icon" src="icons/general/fh-range-bw-icon.png" title="Range Icon" width="42"/>  Most abilities target a figure, and a range value added to an ability determines how far away that figure can be. “<strong>Range X</strong>” means the acting figure can target any figure within X hexes, including the acting figure when permitted. <strong>Range cannot be counted through walls</strong> but can be counted through obstacles, figures, or anything else. Two hexes that share a wall but still have line-of-sight between them (e.g., through an open doorway) are considered to be at range 2 from each other.</p><p>Non-attack abilities with no specified range value can target figures at any range. Any ability with a range value specified in the highlighted section to its right is considered a ranged ability.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Figures treat the hex they occupy as adjacent for the purpose of targeting.</p>
</blockquote><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_22">22</a></strong></p><hr/><h4 id="area-of-effect">Area of Effect</h4><p>Abilities with an area of effect allow the acting figure to target several different figures in multiple hexes at the same time. Rotating and mirroring the depicted area of effect is permitted.</p><p><img alt="Grey Hex Icon" src="icons/general/fh-hex-player-color-icon.png" title="Grey Hex Icon" width="42"/>  Gray indicates the hex which the acting figure occupies. Any attack with an area of effect that includes a gray hex is always considered a melee attack (see <a href="#page_25">p.25</a>).</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> <img alt="Blue Hex Icon" src="icons/general/fh-hex-summon-color-icon.png" title="Blue Hex Icon" width="42"/>  Blue indicates a hex which an ally must occupy. The ability cannot be performed otherwise. The ally is not targeted by the ability.</p>
</blockquote><p><img alt="Red Hex Icon" src="icons/general/fh-hex-attack-color-icon.png" title="Red Hex Icon" width="42"/>  Red indicates the hexes in which figures can be targeted. Only one red hex needs to be within the ability’s range. This initial hex does not need to contain a figure, but it cannot be inside a wall line, though other red hexes can be inside wall lines. Only figures within line-of-sight can be targeted. Allies in red hexes are not targeted by negative abilities, and enemies in red hexes are not targeted by positive abilities, unless otherwise stated.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> <img alt="Blank Hex Icon" src="icons/general/fh-hex-empty-color-icon.png" title="Blank Hex Icon" width="42"/>  Blank hexes are used as spacers between other types of hexes.</p>
</blockquote><p>If an ability with an area of effect gains “<strong>+1</strong> <img alt="Target Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-target-bw-icon.png" title="Target Icon"/>,” an additional figure within the ability’s range, but outside the area of effect, can be targeted.</p><h4 id="added-effects">Added Effects</h4><p>Added effects are attached to an ability and modify it in some way. Common added effects like “<img alt="Push Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-push-color-icon.png" title="Push Icon"/> <strong>X</strong>,” “<img alt="Pull Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-pull-color-icon.png" title="Pull Icon"/> <strong>X</strong>,”or conditions are usually listed in a highlighted section to the right of the ability. All conditional effects — those dependent on consuming an element (see <a href="#page_23">p.23</a>) or paying some other cost — are listed below the ability in a highlighted section with a dotted line border.</p><p>Added effects can be skipped, but the character must choose to do so before drawing an attack modifier card. Conditional effects can also be skipped; the character is not required to pay the cost and, even if they do, they may still choose not to apply the effect. In the case of a skippable effect attached to a multi-target attack ability, they may skip the effect on an attack-by-attack basis, in each case choosing before drawing an attack modifier card, unless otherwise stated.</p><p>More complex added effects might be written below the ability, but not all text below an ability is an added effect. Any text that provides rules for how the ability is performed (e.g., a targeting restriction) is an inherent part of the ability, not an added effect, and cannot be skipped.</p><h4 id="conditional-triggers">Conditional Triggers</h4><p>Some abilities or effects can only occur if something else happens first. These conditional effects are structured as “Apply effect A to apply effect B.” Effect A must be applied for effect B to be applied. If effect A cannot be applied, neither can effect B.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_23">23</a></strong></p><hr/><h4 id="elements">Elements</h4><p>Some actions have an elemental affinity associated with them (fire, ice, air, earth, light, or dark). If an elemental infusion is depicted on an action, when the acting figure performs any part of that action, they must infuse that element <strong>at the end of their turn</strong>.To infuse an element, move its token to the strong column on the element board. A figure cannot infuse an element this way unless they perform at least one of that action’s abilities.</p><div class="table-responsive">

</div><p>At the end of every round, all infused elements wane, moving one column to the left on the element board, from strong to waning or from waning to inert.</p><p>Infused elements can be consumed to add effects to certain abilities or, in some cases, perform new abilities. This is represented by an element icon marked with an <img alt="Consume Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-locked-out-color-icon.png" title="Consume Icon"/> and followed by the added effect. If that element is strong or waning, it can be consumed. Since infusions don’t occur until the end of the turn, any consumed element must be already strong or waning at the start of the turn, prior to any infusions. To consume an element, move its token to the inert column on the element board.</p><p>If an ability depicts multiple separate elemental consumptions, the acting figure chooses which ones to activate. If a single elemental consumption depicts multiple elements, all of those elements must be consumed to activate it. The same element cannot be consumed multiple times in a single turn.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> If an action depicts elemental consumptions in the upper left corner, all of those elements must be consumed to perform any part of the action.</p>

When a wild or mixed element is infused, at the end of their turn, the acting figure chooses which of those elements to infuse.</p>
