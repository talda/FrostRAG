<h3 id="road-events">Road Events</h3><p>A road event is a small thematic interaction that takes place in the world around Frosthaven. The party will resolve a road event at the start of each scenario, with the following exceptions:</p><ul>
<li>At the start of scenario 0 and scenario 1.</li>
<li>When replaying a lost scenario without first returning to Frosthaven.</li>
<li>When moving directly to a new scenario that is linked to the previous scenario (see <a href="#page_48">p.48</a>).</li>
<li>When playing a scenario that takes place within Frosthaven itself.</li>
<li>When playing any scenario in casual mode (see <a href="#page_69">p.69</a>).</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> There are two decks of road events: summer and winter. Draw the top card of the active road event deck that corresponds to the current season, as shown by the next unmarked box on the campaign calendar (see <a href="#page_54">p.54</a>).</p>
</blockquote><p>The party will perform the following steps when resolving an event card:</p><ol>
<li>Read the thematic text on the front of the card.</li>
<li>Collectively choose one of the options.</li>
<li>Read the thematic text on the back of the card for the outcome that corresponds to the chosen option, then resolve the effect written in that section. Only characters who are participating in the scenario are affected by the outcome. Do not read any of the text that corresponds to the other outcome.</li>
<li>Remove the card from the game. If the return icon <img alt="Return Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-return-card-bw-icon.png" title="Return Icon"/> is depicted in the outcome, return the card to the bottom of the corresponding road event deck instead.</li>
</ol><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Some options and outcomes have requirements associated with them. The most common requirement checks whether any of the characters has a specific trait <img alt="Trait Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-trait-bw-icon.png" title="Trait Icon"/> listed on the front of their character mat. Other requirements might refer to the gold, resources, or other campaign stats you have, or whether specific achievement stickers are present on the campaign sheet (see <a href="#page_54">p.54</a>). When the word “collective” is used, the requirement refers to the entire party and can also include any collective resources listed on the campaign sheet. If the requirement is not met, instead read the outcome labeled “otherwise.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Each event also has a reference number A. Throughout the campaign, you will be instructed to add or remove events from the various event decks. These events are always referenced by this number so that they can be easily found. When an event is added to or removed from an event deck, that deck must then be shuffled. Certain events also have an additional icon (<img alt="Unfettered Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-unfettered-icon.png" title="Unfettered Icon"/>/<img alt="Algox Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-algox-icon.png" title="Algox Icon"/>/<img alt="Lurker Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-lurker-icon.png" title="Lurker Icon"/>) to make it easier to identify a large number of cards at once.</p><details>

<h3 id="boat-events">Boat Events</h3>
<p>A boat event is a small thematic interaction in the Biting Sea. When you use the boat upgrade to travel to a scenario on the sea, signified by the boat icon <img alt="Boat Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/outpost/fh-boat-bw-icon.png" title="Boat Icon"/> in the scenario book, draw a boat event <strong>instead of a road event.</strong> These are resolved in the same manner as road events. There is only one boat event deck; boat events are not split into summer and winter.</p>

All doors are closed to start. When a character enters a closed door, they flip over the door tile to its open side, revealing the adjacent room (see <a href="#page_44">p.44</a>). Closed doors do not hinder normal character movement, but they otherwise act as walls. No figure can enter a closed door with forced movement (see <a href="#page_32">p.32</a>). Once a door is open, it is considered a corridor for most purposes, but it still separates rooms and is not part of either room adjacent to it. Door illustrations vary by environment type, but all door tiles function identically.</p><h4 id="corridors">Corridors</h4><p><img alt="Corridor Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-corridor-color-icon.png" title="Corridor Icon" width="42"/>  A corridor is placed on the connection of two map tiles to cover the border hexes and create a single room out of multiple map tiles. Corridors are considered empty hexes and are <strong>not</strong> considered to be overlay tiles for the purposes of determining what other tiles or tokens can be placed in the same hex.</p><h4 id="pressure-plates">Pressure Plates</h4><p><img alt="Pressure Plate Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-pressure-plate-color-icon.png" title="Pressure Plate Icon" width="42"/>  A pressure plate’s trigger and all of its effects are defined by the special rules for the scenario. Jump and flying movements still trigger pressure plates. Pressure plates are considered empty hexes.</p><h4 id="traps">Traps</h4><p><img alt="Trap Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-trap-color-icon.png" title="Trap Icon" width="42"/>  A trap is sprung when any figure enters its hex, except when flying or jumping (unless the jump movement ends there).When a trap is sprung, it applies some effect to the figure who sprang it and is then removed from the map. Trap effects are varied and are specified either by the scenario key — if they are a part of a room’s setup — or by the ability of the figure who placed the trap. If part of a trap’s effect is listed as “damage” in the scenario key, the trap will deal damage equal to 2 plus the scenario level (see <a href="#page_16">p.16</a>).</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> When a trap tile is placed on the map, tokens for the damage and conditions it applies should be placed on the trap tile for easy reference.</p>
</blockquote><h4 id="hazardous-terrain">Hazardous Terrain</h4><p><img alt="Hazardous Terrain Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-hazardous-terrain-color-icon.png" title="Hazardous Terrain Icon" width="42"/>  If any figure enters a hazardous terrain hex, except when flying or jumping (unless the jump movement ends there),</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> that figure suffers damage equal to 1 plus one-third of the scenario level, rounded up (see <a href="#page_16">p.16</a>). 
Unlike trap tiles, hazardous terrain tiles are not removed after their effect is applied; instead they remain on the map indefinitely. Figures do not suffer additional damage when starting a turn in a hazardous terrain tile or exiting a hazardous terrain hex.</p>
</blockquote><h4 id="difficult-terrain">Difficult Terrain</h4><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> <img alt="Difficult Terrain Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-difficult-terrain-color-icon.png" title="Difficult Terrain Icon" width="42"/>  A figure requires 2 movement points to enter a difficult terrain hex, except when flying or jumping (even if the jump movement ends there).</p>
</blockquote><h4 id="icy-terrain">Icy Terrain</h4><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> <img alt="Icy Terrain Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-icy-terrain-color-icon.png" title="Icy Terrain Icon" width="42"/>  If any figure enters an icy terrain hex, except when teleporting, flying, or jumping (even if the jump movement ends there), that figure is forced to move one additional hex, without spending a movement point, in the same direction as the movement that caused them to enter the hex. This extra movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, but it will not occur if it would cause the figure to move through a wall line or to enter a hex occupied by another figure, obstacle, or objective. If the movement causes the figure to enter another icy terrain hex, the effect triggers again.</p>

Obstacles do not block line-of-sight (see <a href="#page_21">p.21</a>).</p><h4 id="objectives">Objectives</h4><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> <img alt="Objectives Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-objective-color-icon.png" title="Objectives Icon" width="42"/>  Objectives are tied to the goals of some scenarios and typically need to be destroyed or protected. In either case, the special rules for the scenario will assign a maximum hit point value to each objective, usually based on the scenario level (see <a href="#page_16">p.16</a>) and the number of characters. Objectives can be targeted by attacks and suffer damage, but are immune to all conditions and forced movement. Objectives are considered to have initiative 99 for the purpose of focusing, unless otherwise stated by the special rules for the scenario, but do not take turns. Any damage an objective suffers is marked by placing damage tokens directly on it. When the total damage suffered by an objective is equal to or greater than its maximum hit point value, the objective is destroyed, and the objective tile is removed from the map. Objectives are considered figures, and the hexes they are in are considered occupied. Objectives are not considered obstacles.</p>
</blockquote><h4 id="walls">Walls</h4><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> <img alt="Walls Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-wall-color-icon.png" title="Walls Icon" width="42"/>  Like the walls on the border of a map tile, figures cannot cross the wall lines into a wall hex by any means, even when flying or jumping. Any section of a map tile surrounded by wall lines is considered to be a separate room.</p>
</blockquote><h4 id="treasures">Treasures</h4><p><img alt="Treasure Goal Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-goal-treasure-icon.png" title="Treasure Goal Icon" width="42"/>  Treasure can be looted by characters (see <a href="#page_32">p.32</a>). When a treasure is looted, its effect is applied and the treasure tile is removed from the map.</p><p><img alt="Numbered Treasure Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-numbered-treasure-icon.png" title="Numbered Treasure Icon" width="42"/>  Goal treasure is related to the completion of a scenario, with effects specified in the special rules for the scenario. Numbered treasure is more varied, with effects specified in the Treasure Index (see <a href="#page_78">p.78</a>).</p><ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> If the treasure provides an item, find one copy of that item in the unavailable supply and add it to your pool of items. You may then use it normally for the remainder of the scenario as if you had brought it into the scenario, even if it puts you above the limit for that type of item (see <a href="#page_35">p.35</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>If the treasure provides an item blueprint, find all copies of that item in the unavailable supply and add them to the available craftable supply (see <a href="#page_58">p.58</a>).</li>
<li>If the treasure provides a random item blueprint, draw a card from the shuffled random item blueprint deck and add it and all other copies of that item (found in the unavailable craftable supply) to the available craftable supply (see <a href="#page_58">p.58</a>).
    <blockquote>

<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Each scenario will have a custom loot deck, built as directed by its scenario book entry and consisting of different types of loot cards. The number of cards of each type specified should be randomly drawn from their own individual decks and shuffled together to form the loot deck.</p>
<p>The four different types of loot are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Money <img alt="Money Token" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-money-bw-icon.png" title="Money Token"/>:</strong> Twenty cards depicting one to three coins, which are each converted to gold based on the scenario level (see below).</li>
<li><strong>Material Resources:</strong> Eight cards per material type (lumber <img alt="Lumber Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/loot/fh-lumber-bw-icon.png" title="Lumber Icon"/>, metal <img alt="Metal Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/loot/fh-metal-bw-icon.png" title="Metal Icon"/>, hide <img alt="Hide Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/loot/fh-hide-bw-icon.png" title="Hide Icon"/>), which provide a varying number of materials based on the number of characters in the scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Herb Resources:</strong> Two cards per herb type (arrowvine <img alt="Arrowvine Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/loot/fh-arrowvine-bw-icon.png" title="Arrowvine Icon"/>, axenut <img alt="Axenut Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/loot/fh-axenut-bw-icon.png" title="Axenut Icon"/>, corpsecap <img alt="Corpsecap Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/loot/fh-corpsecap-bw-icon.png" title="Corpsecap Icon"/>, flamefruit <img alt="Flamefruit Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/loot/fh-flamefruit-bw-icon.png" title="Flamefruit Icon"/>, rockroot <img alt="Rockroot Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/loot/fh-rockroot-bw-icon.png" title="Rockroot Icon"/>, snowthistle <img alt="Snowthistle Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/loot/fh-snowthistle-bw-icon.png" title="Snowthistle Icon"/>), which provide one herb each.</li>
<li><strong>Random Item <img alt="Treasure Chest Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-treasure-chest-bw-icon.png" title="Treasure Chest Icon"/>:</strong> One card that provides a random item (see <a href="#page_32">p.32</a>). This can only be gained once per scenario entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain events will allow you to add a + sticker to a loot card, which provides one additional resource of that type.</p>
<p>Money and resources looted during a scenario are not gained until the end of the scenario (see <a href="#page_47">p.47</a>), but random items are gained immediately when looted.</p>
</blockquote><h2 id="scenario-level">Scenario Level</h2><p>As characters grow in power, the scenario level will also increase to ensure the game is always challenging.</p><p>Monster base stats, trap and hazardous terrain damage, the amount of gold received from coins on loot cards, and the amount of bonus experience for completing a scenario are all dependent on the level of the scenario being played. Refer to the chart for specific values at each level.</p><p>At recommended difficulty, the scenario level is equal to the average level of the characters <strong>divided by 2</strong> (rounded up). For example, if all characters are level 2, the average level (2) divided by 2 (1) means the scenario is still level 1. Only once a character reaches level 3 would the scenario level potentially increase.</p><p>This calculation determines the recommended difficulty, but at the start of any scenario, the scenario level can be set to any number from 0–7. Decreasing the scenario level might be helpful if your party is struggling, while increasing the scenario level can help the game remain challenging as your party grows stronger.</p><div class="table-responsive">

An entire half of a character ability card is considered a single action.</p><p>Monsters will perform one action on their turn. An entire monster ability card is considered a single action.</p><p>An action can be referred to by any of its abilities. For example, if an action contains a “<img alt="Move Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-move-bw-icon.png" title="Move Icon"/> <strong>2</strong>” ability and a “<img alt="Loot Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-loot-bw-icon.png" title="Loot Icon"/> <strong>2</strong>” ability, it can be referred to as both a move action and a loot action.</p><h4 id="abilities">Abilities</h4><p>An <strong>ability</strong> is any grouping of text and/or icons, often found on an ability card, that a figure can perform to interact with the map, themselves, or other figures.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> If an action consists of multiple abilities, these will be separated from each other by ability lines.</p>
</blockquote><p>Abilities in an action are always performed in the order they are written. Figures cannot perform new abilities while resolving a different ability, with the exception of abilities from attack modifier cards.</p><p>Character abilities can be skipped, unless they are mandatory (see <a href="#page_37">p.37</a>).</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_21">21</a></strong></p><hr/><h3 id="important-ability-concepts">Important Ability Concepts</h3><h4 id="line-of-sight">Line-of-Sight</h4><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> When any figure or hex is targeted by any ability, the acting figure must have a clear <strong>line‑of‑sight</strong> to the target in order to perform the ability. Line-of-sight is established if a line can be drawn from any part of the acting figure’s hex to any part of the target hex without touching a wall line.</p>
</blockquote><p>Only walls and closed doors block line-of-sight. Non-targeted abilities are not affected by line-of-sight. If an ability allows a figure to perform it as if occupying a different hex, draw the line from that hex.</p><h4 id="target">Target</h4><p><img alt="Target Icon" src="icons/general/fh-target-bw-icon.png" title="Target Icon" width="42"/>  Abilities accompanied by “<strong>Target X</strong>” allow the acting figure to target up to X different figures within the ability’s range. Targeting and range restrictions, as well as additional effects of the ability, apply to all targets. It is not possible to target the same figure multiple times with the same ability, unless otherwise stated.</p><p>If no target is specified on a targeted ability, the target value is 1, which means it only targets a single figure. For example, if an effect provides “<strong>+1</strong> <img alt="Target Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-target-bw-icon.png" title="Target Icon"/>,” it would give an ability with no specified target value “<img alt="Target Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-target-bw-icon.png" title="Target Icon"/> <strong>2</strong>.”</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Attack (<a href="#page_25">p.25</a>), conditions (<a href="#page_28">p.28</a>), heal (<a href="#page_29">p.29</a>), forced movement (<a href="#page_32">p.32</a>), commanding figures (<a href="#page_33">p.33</a>), and manipulating tiles (<a href="#page_33">p.33</a>) are the only targeted abilities. Targeted abilities cannot be performed if there is no valid target.</p>
</blockquote><h4 id="allies-enemies-and-self">Allies, Enemies, and Self</h4><p>Characters are allies to other characters, monsters are allies to other monsters, and characters and monsters are enemies to each other. <strong>Figures are not their own allies.</strong></p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> In general, negative abilities can only target enemies, and positive abilities can only target allies or the acting figure themselves. Some abilities have specific targeting information that contradicts this rule. An ability specifying its targets as “all” follows these restrictions, but an ability specifying its targets as “all figures” targets both allies and enemies.</p>
</blockquote><p>If any ability specifies its target as “self,” the effect can only be applied to the acting figure.</p><h4 id="range">Range</h4><p><img alt="Range Icon" src="icons/general/fh-range-bw-icon.png" title="Range Icon" width="42"/>  Most abilities target a figure, and a range value added to an ability determines how far away that figure can be. “<strong>Range X</strong>” means the acting figure can target any figure within X hexes, including the acting figure when permitted. <strong>Range cannot be counted through walls</strong> but can be counted through obstacles, figures, or anything else. Two hexes that share a wall but still have line-of-sight between them (e.g., through an open doorway) are considered to be at range 2 from each other.</p><p>Non-attack abilities with no specified range value can target figures at any range. Any ability with a range value specified in the highlighted section to its right is considered a ranged ability.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Figures treat the hex they occupy as adjacent for the purpose of targeting.</p>

Rotating and mirroring the depicted area of effect is permitted.</p><p><img alt="Grey Hex Icon" src="icons/general/fh-hex-player-color-icon.png" title="Grey Hex Icon" width="42"/>  Gray indicates the hex which the acting figure occupies.

The ability cannot be performed otherwise. The ally is not targeted by the ability.</p>
</blockquote><p><img alt="Red Hex Icon" src="icons/general/fh-hex-attack-color-icon.png" title="Red Hex Icon" width="42"/>  Red indicates the hexes in which figures can be targeted. Only one red hex needs to be within the ability’s range. This initial hex does not need to contain a figure, but it cannot be inside a wall line, though other red hexes can be inside wall lines. Only figures within line-of-sight can be targeted. Allies in red hexes are not targeted by negative abilities, and enemies in red hexes are not targeted by positive abilities, unless otherwise stated.</p><blockquote>

</blockquote><p>If an ability with an area of effect gains “<strong>+1</strong> <img alt="Target Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-target-bw-icon.png" title="Target Icon"/>,” an additional figure within the ability’s range, but outside the area of effect, can be targeted.</p><h4 id="added-effects">Added Effects</h4><p>Added effects are attached to an ability and modify it in some way. Common added effects like “<img alt="Push Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-push-color-icon.png" title="Push Icon"/> <strong>X</strong>,” “<img alt="Pull Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-pull-color-icon.png" title="Pull Icon"/> <strong>X</strong>,”or conditions are usually listed in a highlighted section to the right of the ability. All conditional effects — those dependent on consuming an element (see <a href="#page_23">p.23</a>) or paying some other cost — are listed below the ability in a highlighted section with a dotted line border.</p><p>Added effects can be skipped, but the character must choose to do so before drawing an attack modifier card. Conditional effects can also be skipped; the character is not required to pay the cost and, even if they do, they may still choose not to apply the effect. In the case of a skippable effect attached to a multi-target attack ability, they may skip the effect on an attack-by-attack basis, in each case choosing before drawing an attack modifier card, unless otherwise stated.</p><p>More complex added effects might be written below the ability, but not all text below an ability is an added effect. Any text that provides rules for how the ability is performed (e.g., a targeting restriction) is an inherent part of the ability, not an added effect, and cannot be skipped.</p><h4 id="conditional-triggers">Conditional Triggers</h4><p>Some abilities or effects can only occur if something else happens first. These conditional effects are structured as “Apply effect A to apply effect B.” Effect A must be applied for effect B to be applied.

</table><p>Some attacks have abilities (e.g., heal abilities) that aren’t attack effects but are still attached to the attack. These abilities are performed after the attack is resolved completely (including after any retaliate bonus).</p><p>Some modifiers have added effects, besides modifying the attack value, and <strong>an attacking character can always choose</strong> whether to apply those effects after the modifier is drawn.</p><blockquote>

<p>The first non-rolling modifier and the one after it are compared. If the attack has advantage, the attacker uses all initial rolling modifiers and whichever of the last two modifiers they choose. If the attack has disadvantage, the attacker ignores all initial rolling modifiers and uses whichever of the last two modifiers is worse.</p>
<p>If the first draw with advantage or disadvantage is not a rolling modifier, but the second draw is, the rolling icon on the second modifier is still ignored.</p>
</blockquote><p>When there is ambiguity about which modifier is worse, the attacker must use the one drawn first. Ambiguity occurs when comparing the non-numeric effects of some modifiers (e.g., elemental infusions or negative conditions). Any non-numeric effect is considered to have a positive but undefined value.</p><p>An attack cannot gain multiple instances of advantage or disadvantage.

This reduces the attack value of an incoming attack by X. The shield bonus is only applied after all attack bonuses or penalties and modifiers have been applied. Multiple shield bonuses stack with one another as a single reduction in attack value. <strong>A shield bonus does not apply to sources of damage that are not attacks.</strong></p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> A shield ability always applies to the acting figure.</p>
</blockquote><h4 id="retaliate">Retaliate</h4><p><img alt="Retaliate Icon" src="icons/general/fh-retaliate-bw-icon.png" title="Retaliate Icon" width="42"/>  “<strong>Retaliate X</strong>” is a positive ability that gives the acting figure a retaliate bonus of X. This deals X damage to any figure who attacks them, if they are within the specified range after all attack effects are resolved (including push or pull). If no range is specified, the bonus is only applied to adjacent attackers. This bonus is triggered by each attack and occurs after the attack is resolved. A retaliate bonus is not an attack or targeted effect, therefore the damage cannot be reduced by a shield bonus. If a retaliating figure is killed or exhausted by an attack, the retaliate bonus does not occur. Multiple retaliate bonuses stack with one another as a single source of damage, but each retaliate bonus is only applied within its specified range.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> A retaliate ability always applies to the acting figure.</p>
</blockquote><h4 id="summon">Summon</h4><p>Summon is a positive ability that adds other allied figures to the map. These figures, known as “summons,” must be placed in different empty hexes adjacent to the summoner. If there is no adjacent hex available, the figure is not summoned.</p><p>A character summon is considered a persistent bonus, and their card is placed in the summoner’s active area. When the summon’s hit point value is reduced to zero, the summon is removed from the map. The summoner may voluntarily remove the summon from the map at any time except during another ability. The card is then placed in the summoner’s discard pile or lost pile, depending on whether the action has a lost icon (see <a href="#page_38">p.38</a>).</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Each character summon has a corresponding standee, found in the summoner’s tuck box, that is used to represent them on the map, using a blue standee base.</p>
</blockquote><p>When a character becomes exhausted, all of their summons are removed from the map.</p><p>Character summons have stats for their hit point, attack, move, and range values, along with any special traits listed on their ability cards. If a summon’s attack or move value is “–”, then they do not perform that ability unless granted an ability with a base value. If a summon’s range value is “–”, then they do not perform ranged attacks unless granted that ability (see <a href="#page_33">p.33</a>).</p><p>A character summon’s turn in the initiative order is always directly before their summoner and is separate from the summoner’s turn. Summons are not controlled by their summoner, but instead obey automated monster rules, performing “<img alt="Move Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-move-bw-icon.png" title="Move Icon"/><strong>+0</strong>, <img alt="Attack Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-attack-bw-icon.png" title="Attack Icon"/><strong>+0</strong>” (see <a href="#page_41">p.41</a>).

</blockquote><p>A character can have multiple summons on the map at once. Each new summon’s card is placed to the right of the previous summon’s card in the summoner’s active area. In such cases, the summons will act in that order (from left to right). If there are multiple copies of the same summon on the map at once, the order in which they were summoned determines their acting order, which can be tracked using their standee numbers.</p><p><strong>Summons never take a turn during the round in which they are summoned.</strong></p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_32">32</a></strong></p><hr/><h3 id="forced-movement">Forced Movement</h3><blockquote>

</blockquote><p>Forced movement must follow all normal movement rules for the target. For example, if a flying figure is forced to move, flying still applies. There are two primary forced movement abilities:</p><p><img alt="Push Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-push-color-icon.png" title="Push Icon" width="42"/>  “<strong>Push X</strong>” forces the target to move up to X hexes away from the acting figure. Each individual hex entered must place the target farther by range from the acting figure.</p><p><img alt="Pull Icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-pull-color-icon.png" title="Pull Icon" width="42"/>  “<strong>Pull X</strong>” forces the target to move up to X hexes toward the acting figure. Each individual hex entered must place the target closer by range to the acting figure.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> When a character performs a push or a pull, they decide the direction and distance that the target moves.</p>
</blockquote><p>When a monster performs a push or a pull, the party decides the direction, but the target must move as far as possible. Push and pull are unaffected by difficult terrain, but all other normal movement rules are still applied (including the rules for flying figures). Immobilized or stunned figures can still be affected by push, pull, and teleport but not by any other type of forced movement.</p><p>Push and pull can also be added to other abilities as an added effect, allowing the forced movement of one or more targets of that ability after its main effect is resolved.

This ability is unaffected by the presence of figures or overlay tiles. If there are no loot tokens or treasure tiles within the specified range, the ability cannot be performed.</p><blockquote>

<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Commanding figures is a targeted ability that allows a figure to command another figure to perform certain abilities. There are two ways to command figures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grant:</strong> Allows a figure to grant an ability to any figure. The commanded figure then performs that ability. If the commanded figure is a character summon or scenario ally, the commanding figure decides how the ability is performed.</li>
<li><strong>Control:</strong> Allows a figure to control an ability of an enemy. The commanded figure then performs that ability, and the commanding figure decides how the ability is performed. During this ability, the commanded figure treats the commanding figure’s allies and enemies as their own allies and enemies. When a move ability is controlled, it is considered forced movement.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Manipulating tiles is any ability that allows a figure to alter the layout of overlay tiles on the map. There are six ways to manipulate tiles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create:</strong> Allows a figure to place an overlay tile.</li>
<li><strong>Destroy:</strong> Allows a figure to remove an overlay tile.</li>
<li><strong>Relocate:</strong> Allows a figure to remove an overlay tile and place it elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong>Move:</strong> Allows a figure to move an overlay tile up to the specified number of hexes, much like a figure would move. Overlay tiles can only be moved through featureless hexes, including occupied hexes.</li>
<li><strong>Replace:</strong> Allows a figure to destroy an overlay tile in order to create a different overlay tile in the same hex.</li>
<li><strong>Spring:</strong> Allows a figure to destroy a trap and apply the effects of the trap to themselves, unless otherwise stated.</li>
</ul>
<p>No hex can have more than one overlay tile in it (except corridors and open doors). Traps and obstacles cannot be placed in or moved into occupied hexes. If hazardous terrain is placed in an occupied hex, its effects are not applied to the figure in that hex. When manipulating obstacles, <strong>figures cannot cut off one area of the map from another,</strong> leaving an area that cannot be entered without going through an obstacle. Figures cannot manipulate any overlay tile that is covering a border hex of a map tile.</p>

<li><strong>Actions:</strong> Each card has a top action and a bottom action. The abilities of an action are performed from top to bottom, with each ability separated by an ability line. After the action is performed, the card is placed in the character’s active area, discard pile, or lost pile, depending on the card’s icons. A character may choose not to perform an action, in which case the card is discarded with no effect.</li>
<li><strong>Basic Action</strong> Icons: An ability card can always be used for a basic “<img alt="Attack Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-attack-bw-icon.png" title="Attack Icon"/> <strong>2</strong>” top action or “<img alt="Move Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-move-bw-icon.png" title="Move Icon"/> <strong>2</strong>” bottom action.

</blockquote><p>For a melee attack, the monster identifies the shortest possible path to a hex from which it can perform the melee attack. For a ranged attack, the monster identifies the shortest possible path to a hex from which it can perform the ranged attack within the specified range. If the monster cannot attack on its turn, either because it does not have an attack ability or because it has disarm, it focuses as if for a single-target melee attack.</p><p>If the shortest possible path would bring the monster within range of multiple enemies, it focuses on the one who is closest by range to its current hex. If those enemies are all equally close, it focuses on the one who acts earliest in the initiative order.</p><h4 id="additional-foci">Additional Foci</h4><p>If a monster’s attack ability allows it to attack multiple targets, it first finds a primary focus, then finds additional foci for the extra attacks. The monster does this by identifying the shortest possible path to a hex from which it can attack its primary focus and as many additional targets as the attack ability allows during its current turn.</p><h4 id="path-priority">Path Priority</h4><p>Monsters always prioritize a path that triggers the fewest negative hexes, like traps and hazardous terrain, even when that means not maximizing targets. Monsters only trigger negative hexes when there is no other viable path to attack an enemy. For example, if a monster could attack by moving two hexes and springing a trap on the way, or by moving 10 hexes and avoiding the trap, it would take the longer path.</p><p>It does not matter whether the monster can actually reach the end of the path on its current turn. As long as there is a path to reach a hex from which to attack an enemy, the monster can focus on that enemy. Focus does not require line-of-sight.</p><h4 id="no-focus">No Focus</h4><p>It is possible that a monster is unable to find a focus if it cannot reach a valid hex, given infinite movement, from which it can perform its attack. In such cases, the monster does not move or attack but still performs any other abilities listed on its ability card.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_42">42</a></strong></p><hr/><h3 id="monster-movement">Monster Movement</h3><p>Once a monster has found a focus and identified its path to that focus, it then performs the abilities listed on its ability card in order — the first of which is usually to move. A monster only moves on its turn if “<img alt="Move Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-move-bw-icon.png" title="Move Icon"/> <strong>± X</strong>” is listed on its ability card. This move ability gives the monster an amount of movement points equal to its base move stat (found on its stat card) modified by X (either positive or negative).</p><p>A monster always uses the fewest movement points required to maximize its attacks for its current turn. If a monster cannot attack its focus on its current turn, it only moves if it can shorten the path to its focus. When a monster performs a ranged attack on an adjacent target, it first moves away from that target if possible, so that the attack does not have disadvantage.</p><blockquote>

<p><strong>Active Bonuses:</strong> Active bonuses from a stat card are active at all times, even if the monster is stunned. Active bonuses from an ability card are only active once the monster has taken its turn, but they remain active until the end of the round, even if the monster is later stunned. Multiple active bonuses, from either type of card, stack with one another as a single effect.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Heal Abilities:</strong> The monster heals itself or an ally within the specified range. It always targets the monster within range that has the greatest difference between its current and maximum hit point values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loot Abilities:</strong> Monsters do not perform end-of-turn looting, unlike characters, but some monsters have loot abilities. In such cases, the monster loots all loot tokens within the specified range, removing them from the map. These loot tokens are not dropped by the monster when it dies. Monsters are unable to loot treasure tiles.</p>

It always targets the monster at the closest range that does not already have the condition. If there is a tie for closest range, it targets the monster that acts earliest in the initiative order.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Summon Abilities:</strong> Some monsters can summon other monsters onto the map. Monster summons behave just like other monsters, acting according to the monster ability cards of their set. <br/>
A monster summon must be placed in an empty hex adjacent to its summoner and as close to an enemy as possible. If there is no adjacent hex available, or no standee of the corresponding monster type, the figure is not summoned. Monster summons never take a turn during the round in which they are summoned. When a summoner is killed, its monster summons remain on the map.</p>

<li><strong>Revealing Monsters:</strong> When the section book indicates that monsters are revealed in a new room, add them to the map immediately, along with any indicated overlay tiles or tokens, as you would when setting up a scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Spawning Monsters:</strong> If the scenario rules indicate that monsters spawn in specific locations at specific times, add them to the map when specified. If a specified location is not empty, place the monster in the closest empty hex instead.</li>
</ol><p>Unlike monsters that have been summoned, monsters that have been revealed or spawned act during the same round in which they were added to the map. If a newly added monster set does not have an ability card drawn for the current round, draw one now.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Check the initiative value for the sets of all added monsters.

If their initiative value comes before the acting figure’s initiative value, move or insert their initiative order token after the acting figure’s token; they will act next. When multiple new monster sets would act next, order their tokens based on initiative values.</p>
</blockquote><p>When monsters are added to the map, if there are not enough standees of the right type, place as many monsters as possible, starting with elite monsters, in order of proximity to an enemy. Once the standees run out, do not place the remaining monsters. If there are not enough bases of the right color, place the remaining monsters without bases.</p><h3 id="named-monsters">Named Monsters</h3><p>Named monsters are a special class of monster.

</blockquote><p>Bosses are not considered normal or elite, so they are not affected by abilities that target those ranks. In addition to providing stats, a boss’s stat card describes its special abilities, which are activated by its ability cards. A boss’s stats might refer to “C,” which represents the number of characters in the scenario.</p><p>If the special abilities of a boss are too complex to fit on its stat card, the scenario rules will provide more information.</p><h3 id="monster-damage-and-death">Monster Damage and Death</h3><p>When a monster suffers damage, place damage tokens on its stat sleeve in the section corresponding to its standee number. As soon as the total amount of damage suffered by a monster is equal to or greater than its maximum hit point value, it dies.</p><p>When a monster dies, remove its standee from the map, clear all tokens from its section of the stat sleeve, and</p><blockquote>

If a monster dies while performing one of its own abilities, it cannot perform any other abilities.</p><h4 id="kill-credit">Kill Credit</h4><p>Certain battle goals, personal quests, and abilities require characters to track their kills. Summons pass credit for their kills to their summoner.</p><p>If a monster dies from damage caused by an attack, retaliate bonus, or suffer damage ability, the figure who caused the damage gets credit for the kill. If a monster dies from damage caused by a negative hex due to forced movement, the figure who caused the forced movement gets credit for the kill.</p><p>If a monster dies from damage caused by wound, bane, another monster, or a negative hex due to voluntary movement, no kill credit is given.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_46">46</a></strong></p><hr/><h2 id="end-of-round">End Of Round</h2><p>After all figures on the map have taken a turn (except figures that were summoned during the round), the End of Round step begins.

</ol><h2 id="common-scenario-rules">Common Scenario Rules</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Allies:</strong> Certain figures are allies of the party. Each ally is represented either by a monster standee, in which case their stats are defined by their monster stat card, or by a numbered scenario aid token, in which case their stats are defined by the scenario rules. When multiple numbered tokens are used to represent allies, randomize them to determine their acting order. Like summons, allies are not controlled by any character, obeying automated monster rules instead.
    <blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> When allies attack, they use the ally attack modifier deck.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Equations:</strong> Certain variables, such as hit point values for objectives or named monsters, are determined by equations. These equations can depend on scenario level (L), number of characters (C), or maximum hit point value of an elite monster of the relevant type (H). For example, if a named Polar Bear has (C × H) hit points, then its maximum hit point value is equal to the number of characters multiplied by the maximum hit point value of an elite Polar Bear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Escaping:</strong> Certain scenarios require the party to escape. In these scenarios, certain hexes on the map are designated as escape hexes. If a character ends their turn in an escape hex, they may escape. Their figure is then removed from the map, along with their summons and tokens. Escaped characters can no longer participate in the scenario in any way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> <strong>Linked Hexes:</strong> Certain hexes on the map are linked to each other. Linked hexes are considered adjacent for the purpose of movement. There is no line-of-sight between linked hexes, but figures can find focus through linked hexes.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Locked Doors:</strong> Certain doors are locked at the start of the scenario. Locked doors cannot be opened normally. They act as walls until the specified conditions which unlock them have been met. Once unlocked, they can be opened normally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Round Track:</strong> If a scenario has effects that occur at specific times, the rounds can be tracked via the round track at the top of the element board. Advance the round marker one space at the end of each round.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Scenario Aid Tokens:</strong> These numbered or lettered tokens represent allies or loot or even act as reminders for special rules, such as where enemies spawn or when to read a section. These tokens do not affect the empty status of a hex, unless they are representing a figure.</li>

The pad contains multiple sheets, in case they are needed for any reason, but only one campaign can be in progress at any given time.</p><p>The campaign sheet has the following:</p><ol type="A">
<li><strong>Campaign Calendar:</strong> This tracks the passage of time, measured in weeks. When the party returns to Frosthaven after a scenario, mark the next box. You might also be instructed to mark the next box at other times in the campaign. Marking these boxes can have various effects (see <a href="#page_59">p.59</a>).There are 10 weeks per season and two seasons, summer and winter, per year. If the campaign lasts longer than four years, use a new campaign sheet to continue tracking the passage of time.</li>
<li><strong>Frosthaven Supply:</strong> This tracks the party’s resources. Any material resources here can be used to pay various costs for buildings, while any herb resources here can be used to craft items and brew potions. All resources here can be used to pay collective costs from scenarios or events. At any time, characters can move resources from their personal supplies to the Frosthaven supply, but they cannot move resources from the Frosthaven supply to their personal supplies.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration Value:</strong> This marks the party’s current inspiration. When the party receives “±X inspiration,” adjust this value accordingly. When the party completes a scenario, they gain inspiration equal to 4 minus the number of characters. The party can spend any amount of inspiration in place of an equal number of material resources when paying various costs for buildings. Characters can spend 15 inspiration when retiring to complete an additional personal quest (see <a href="#page_64">p.64</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Total Defense Value:</strong> This marks Frosthaven’s current defense. This value is mainly referenced when resolving attack events (see <a href="#page_60">p.60</a>). When the party receives “±X defense,” adjust this value accordingly. Modifiers from the morale track are not cumulative; only the current modifier is applicable.</li>
<li><strong>Soldiers:</strong> These can be spent during an attack event to improve the chances of success on any defense check (see <a href="#page_61">p.61</a>). When the party gains or loses X soldiers, mark or erase X circles accordingly. The maximum number of soldiers the party can have is limited by the current level of the Barracks.</li>
<li><strong>Morale Track:</strong> This marks Frosthaven’s current morale. Certain event outcomes have a morale requirement, and Frosthaven’s total defense is affected by the modifier indicated next to the current morale (see <a href="#page_61">p.61</a>). When the party receives “±X morale,” adjust this track accordingly. The party can lose 1 morale to perform a repair, instead of spending resources (see <a href="#page_61">p.61</a>), and they can lose 2 morale to perform an extra build or upgrade (see <a href="#page_68">p.68</a>). The morale track has a minimum value (0) and a maximum value (20).If the minimum or maximum is ever reached, read the indicated section from the section book. The party’s starting morale is determined at the end of scenario 1.</li>
<li><strong>Campaign Stickers:</strong> This tracks the party’s campaign stickers. When the party gains a campaign sticker, affix it here. If one campaign sticker is gained and another lost at the same time, cover the old sticker with the new one. Having a specific campaign sticker can change the outcome of an event or scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Prosperity Track:</strong> This marks Frosthaven’s current prosperity. The prosperity level determines the maximum starting level for new characters (see <a href="#page_65">p.65</a>) and the maximum level for building upgrades (see <a href="#page_68">p.68</a>). When the party receives “+X prosperity,” mark the next X boxes. Each time a numbered box is marked, the prosperity level increases. When the party receives “-X prosperity,” erase the previous X boxes, but never erase a numbered box or further.</li>

<li><strong>Retirement Table:</strong> This serves as an ongoing record of retired characters. When a character retires (see <a href="#page_64">p.64</a>), record their information in this table. The number of characters a player has retired during the campaign determines how many bonus perk marks are gained by newly created characters (see <a href="#page_63">p.63</a>).</li>

These two groups are kept separate in the game box with a divider card and are split further into subgroups of purchasable items and craftable items, depending on whether they have a gold cost or a crafting cost.</p><p>Items can be added to the available supply in the following ways:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Upgrading Buildings:</strong> When the Craftsman or certain other buildings are upgraded, move the listed items from the unavailable supply to the corresponding available supply (either purchasable items or craftable items, depending on the building).</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Crafting and Selling:</strong> When a character spends an item to pay a crafting cost (see <a href="#page_65">p.65</a>) or sells an item for gold (see <a href="#page_67">p.67</a>), return the item to the corresponding available supply.</p>

<p>If the scenario was lost, the party may replay the scenario immediately (see <a href="#page_47">p.47</a>).</p>
</li>

<p>If the scenario has any linked scenarios available, the party may play one of the linked scenarios immediately. Some scenarios are force-linked, in which case the party must play the indicated linked scenario immediately (see <a href="#page_48">p.48</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The Outpost Phase involves spending time in Frosthaven to resolve events, acquire new items and abilities, and interact with buildings. Each Outpost Phase consists of five distinct steps:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Passage of Time</strong></li>

<li><strong>Building Operations</strong></li>
<li><strong>Downtime</strong></li>
<li><strong>Construction</strong></li>
</ol><h2 id="1-passage-of-time">1. Passage of Time</h2><p>At the start of the Outpost Phase, time passes. Mark the next unmarked box on the calendar to signify that one week has passed.</p><p>You will occasionally be instructed to add section numbers to future weeks on the calendar. Count the indicated number of weeks past the last marked box, then write the section number in that box. When you mark a box that contains a section number, immediately read the indicated section from the section book. If there are multiple section numbers, read those sections one at a time, in any order.</p><p>In some events and scenarios, time can pass outside of the Outpost Phase. When this happens, if you mark a box that contains a section number, do not read the indicated section immediately. Instead, write the section number in the next unmarked box, to be triggered when time passes during the next Outpost Phase.</p><p>When a set of 10 boxes on the calendar has been filled, a change of season occurs — either from summer to winter (filling the first half of a row) or from winter to summer (filling the second half of a row). The main difference between the two seasons is which deck will be used for road and outpost events.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_60">60</a></strong></p><hr/><h2 id="2-outpost-event">2. Outpost Event</h2><p>After the Passage of Time step, unless you were instructed not to resolve an outpost event this week, draw the top card of the active outpost event deck and resolve it. If the calendar shows summer, draw a summer outpost event. If the calendar shows winter, draw a winter outpost event. Outpost events are resolved exactly like road events (see <a href="#page_12">p.12</a>).</p><h3 id="attack-events">Attack Events</h3><p>Attack events are special outpost events that require the party to defend Frosthaven from attack. During these attacks, buildings will be targeted and potentially damaged or even wrecked. The frequency of attacks is significantly higher in winter than in summer.</p><p>The attack is depicted on the back of the event card, below any outcomes from the choice presented on the front of the event card. These outcomes often modify the attack in some way. The back of the card contains the following:</p><ol type="A">
<li><strong>Attack Value:</strong> This indicates the value that must be met or exceeded on a defense check to defend a targeted building.</li>
<li><strong>Target Value:</strong> This indicates the total number of buildings targeted by the attack. The party must perform a separate defense check for each targeted building.</li>
<li><strong>Target Priority:</strong> This indicates which non-wrecked buildings are targeted by the attack, and in what order, based on their reference numbers. If the attack has no target priority, the party decides. Each building can only be targeted once, even if the number of buildings within the target priority is lower than the target value.</li>

For each defense check, draw a card from the town guard deck and add its bonus to Frosthaven’s total defense value (along with any modifiers from the event).</p><p>For any defense check, as long as the Barracks is not wrecked, the party can lose any number of soldiers before drawing to give the check advantage and reduce the attack value, based on the level of the Barracks and the number of soldiers lost. The defense check gains disadvantage if the Barracks is wrecked.</p><p>If the result meets or exceeds the attack value, the defense check succeeds and the building is defended. The defense check automatically succeeds when the “success” card is drawn and applied. Otherwise, the defense check fails and the building is damaged. For some attack events, the building is wrecked instead. The building is automatically wrecked when the “wrecked” card is drawn and applied.</p><p>Do not resolve any effects of buildings being damaged or wrecked during the attack until the entire attack event has fully resolved. Reshuffle the town guard deck after the attack and as needed during the attack if the deck is depleted.</p><h3 id="damaged-buildings">Damaged Buildings</h3><p><img alt="Building Repair Icon" src="icons/general/fh-building-repair-bw-icon.png" title="Building Repair Icon" width="42"/>  When a building is damaged, the party must immediately pay the repair cost shown on its building card. This cost can be paid with material resources of any type from the Frosthaven supply or the characters’ personal supplies, in any combination. If the party cannot or does not want to pay this cost, they lose 1 morale instead.</p><h3 id="wrecked-buildings">Wrecked Buildings</h3><p><img alt="Wrecked Building Icon" src="icons/general/fh-building-wrecked-bw-icon.png" title="Wrecked Building Icon" width="42"/>  When a building is wrecked, flip its building card to the wrecked side.

Building Operations</h2><p>After the Outpost Event step, resolve the effects of all buildings. Go through the building deck in sequential order, one card at a time. For each building, resolve any normal or wrecked effect, which appears at the top of its card next to the <img alt="Building Operation Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-building-operation-bw-icon.png" title="Building Operation Icon"/> icon.</p><p>When the party gains or loses gold or resources due to these effects, they can be added to or taken from the Frosthaven supply or the characters’ personal supplies, in any combination. If a loss cannot be resolved fully, the party loses as much as possible, but there is no other penalty. However, some buildings have optional effects, with benefits that can only be gained if the associated cost is paid fully.</p><p>Because the Building Operations step occurs immediately after the Outpost Event step, any building that was wrecked during the outpost event will have its wrecked effect resolved once before the party even has an opportunity to rebuild it.</p><details>

<p>Once the Garden has been built, the party may spend any one herb resource during the Building Operations step to affix a matching sticker to any plot. The Garden starts with only one plot, but more plots become available at higher levels. Each plot can only have one sticker at a time, but any sticker can be covered by another sticker later.</p>
<p>The Garden will be harvested every two weeks (or every week at higher levels) when it is not wrecked. When the Garden is harvested, for each plot with a sticker, the party gains one matching herb resource. Do not remove the stickers.</p>
<p>When the Garden is upgraded to level 2, make sure to keep its card in the same orientation within the building deck.</p>
</details><h2 id="4-downtime">4. Downtime</h2><p>After the Building Operations step, characters may perform downtime activities in any order they would like. Many of these activities require characters to interact with a specific building, which they cannot do if the building is wrecked.</p><ul>

Leveling up has an experience requirement, as shown on the character sheet, but not an experience cost. A character’s experience total does not reset when they level up.</p><p>If a character’s level is lower than half the current prosperity level (rounded up), they may level up during the Downtime step without meeting the experience requirement, even multiple times, as long as their level does not exceed half the current prosperity level (rounded up). After they level up, set their experience total to match the experience requirement of their new level. This method of leveling up is optional, unlike leveling up through experience.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_63">63</a></strong></p><hr/><p>Leveling up can only be done during the Outpost Phase. Characters cannot level up during a scenario or even between scenarios if the party does not return to Frosthaven for an Outpost Phase (e.g., when the party attempts a linked scenario).</p><p>When a character levels up, they must do the following:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Add Ability Card:</strong> Add one new ability card to their pool. The card they choose must match their class and must be of a level equal to or lower than their new level. For example, when a character reaches level 2, they can add one of their two level 2 ability cards. Then, when they reach level 3, they can add one of their two level 3 ability cards or their other level 2 ability card. This does not increase their maximum hand size, it simply increases the pool of cards available to them at the start of a scenario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Increase Hit Points:</strong> Increase their maximum hit point value. On the level track at the bottom of their character mat, the number printed in red below their new level indicates their new maximum hit point value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gain Perk Mark:</strong> Gain one new perk mark <img alt="Checked Perk Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-checked-perk-icon.png" title="Checked Perk Icon"/>.The new perk mark is applied to the list on the right side of their character sheet by marking one corresponding box. Additional rules for gaining perks are outlined below.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4 id="perks">Perks</h4><p>Perks allow characters to fine-tune their attack modifier decks by adding and removing cards permanently. When a character gains a perk mark, they choose a perk from the perk list on the right side of their character sheet, mark the corresponding box, and resolve any change to their attack modifier deck. The effects of a perk are resolved as soon as the perk is gained, even when it is gained outside of the Downtime step.</p><p>The number of unlinked boxes shown next to a perk in the perk list indicates the maximum number of times that the perk can be gained, with each box requiring one perk mark. Some perks instead have multiple linked boxes, and all of these boxes must be filled with perk marks to gain the perk once.</p><p>The “ignore item <img alt="Minus 1 Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-minus-1-bw-icon.png" title="Minus 1 Icon"/> effects” perk only applies to the added <img alt="Minus 1 Color Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-minus-1-color-icon.png" title="Minus 1 Color Icon"/> attack modifier cards denoted in the lower left corner of some items. The “ignore scenario effects” perk only applies to effects labeled as scenario effects in the scenario book. If a perk provides the character with any other benefit unrelated to their attack modifier deck, they can keep the relevant perk reminder card in their active area as a reminder.</p><p>Perk marks can be gained in four ways:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Leveling Up:</strong> Each time a character levels up, they gain one perk mark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gaining Checkmarks:</strong> Each time a character completes a set of three checkmarks, they gain one perk mark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Creating Characters:</strong> Each time a new character is created, they gain a number of perk marks equal to the number of characters previously retired by that player during the campaign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Achieving Masteries:</strong> Each time a character achieves a new mastery, they gain one perk mark.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Sometimes, a character will be instructed to lose checkmarks. However, perk marks cannot be lost, so checkmarks can only be lost back to the last complete set of three checkmarks. For example, if a character has eight checkmarks, it is possible for them to lose up to two checkmarks, but no more.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_64">64</a></strong></p><hr/><h3 id="retire-a-character">Retire a Character</h3><p>If a character has fulfilled the requirements of their personal quest, they must retire during the Downtime step, though they can perform all other downtime activities they would like to before doing so. Having achieved what they set out to do, they are no longer motivated to explore the monster-filled wilderness. Retired characters can no longer participate in the campaign with the rest of the party.</p><p>When a character retires, the completion of their personal quest gains the party 2 prosperity and unlocks the building envelope specified on the personal quest card. If a specified envelope is already unlocked, the alternate envelope is unlocked instead. If both envelopes are already unlocked, the party instead gains a random scenario (or 1 inspiration if that deck is depleted) and a random item blueprint (or 1 inspiration if that deck is depleted).</p><p>The retiring character may spend 15 inspiration once to draw two additional personal quests and choose one to complete immediately, without fulfilling its requirements, and shuffle the other back into the deck. This gains the party 2 more prosperity and unlocks another building envelope. The effects of completing two personal quests upon retirement are resolved simultaneously, so that they do not influence each other.</p><p>A personal quest card has the following:</p><ol type="A">
<li><strong>Title:</strong> A thematic title for the quest.</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> A short description of the quest.</li>
<li><strong>Requirements:</strong> The specific requirements for completing the quest.</li>

</ol><h4 id="after-retirement">After Retirement</h4><p>For each class, the first time a character of that class retires during the campaign, flip their character mat over and find the section number found near the bottom on the back side. After the retiring character has resolved the completion of their personal quest, read the indicated section from the section book.</p><p>As characters retire, record them in the retirement table on the campaign sheet, noting the character name, player name, and the other indicated information. When a new character is created, they gain one perk mark for each character previously retired by that player. If a single player is playing solo with multiple characters (see <a href="#page_69">p.69</a>), count each character’s lineage separately for this purpose.</p><p>After a character retires, their personal quest is removed from the game, as well as any additional personal quest they completed upon retirement. Their character materials are put back in the corresponding tuck boxes. Their items are returned to the available supply, their resources are moved to the Frosthaven supply, and their gold is lost.</p><p>Retirement can only be done during the Downtime step. Characters cannot retire during a scenario or even between scenarios if the party does not return to Frosthaven for an Outpost Phase (e.g., when the party attempts a linked scenario).</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_65">65</a></strong></p><hr/><h3 id="create-a-character">Create a Character</h3><p>After a player retires their previous character, or if they simply wish to try something new, they can create a new character during the Downtime step.</p><p>If their previous character has not yet been retired, the player can either set the character aside to play again later or abandon the character. When set aside, their personal quest, items, gold, and resources are all kept. When abandoned, their personal quest is shuffled back into the deck, their items are returned to the available supply, their resources are moved to the Frosthaven supply, and their gold is lost.</p><p>When creating a character, a player may choose any class without an active character. This includes classes that have already been played during the campaign, as long as all previous characters of the chosen class have been retired or abandoned (not merely set aside). As the campaign progresses, new classes will be unlocked.</p><h4 id="initial-benefits">Initial Benefits</h4><p>The new character draws two personal quests, choosing one to keep and shuffling the other back into the deck. It is possible for the personal quest deck to get depleted. When this happens, any new characters created during the campaign do not receive personal quests and therefore cannot ever be retired. Players can still set aside or abandon such characters whenever they wish, however.</p><p>The new character starts with (10 × P + 20) gold, where “P” is the current prosperity level. This starting gold must be spent immediately on items in the available purchasable supply. Any unspent remainder is lost.</p><p>The new character gains a number of perk marks equal to the number of characters previously retired by that player during the campaign.</p><h4 id="prosperity-leveling">Prosperity Leveling</h4><p>Since a new character always starts at level 1, they may immediately level up without meeting the experience requirement, even multiple times, as long as their level does not exceed half the current prosperity level (rounded up). After they level up, set their experience total to match the experience requirement of their new level.</p><h3 id="craft-items">Craft Items</h3><p>Non-potion items can be crafted by interacting with the Craftsman building. Characters craft an item by spending the required resources or items. When paying crafting costs, material resources cannot be taken from the Frosthaven supply, but herb resources can. The crafting character gains one copy of the crafted item.</p><p>At the start of the campaign, only items 001–010 are available to be crafted. As the Craftsman gets upgraded and as the party discovers new item blueprints, more items will be added to the available craftable supply. Any item in the available craftable supply can be crafted.</p><p>When an item is required to craft another item, if all copies of the required item are owned by other members of the party, the crafting character may spend the gold, resources, or items listed as the required item’s cost in place of spending the item itself.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_66">66</a></strong></p><hr/><h3 id="brew-potions">Brew Potions</h3><p>Potion items can be brewed by interacting with the Alchemist building. Characters brew a potion by spending any two herb resources, taken from the Frosthaven supply or their personal supply, in any combination. Refer to the combination of those two herbs on the alchemy chart to see which potion is brewed. The brewing character gains one copy of the brewed potion, which they may keep or immediately give to another member of the party.</p><p>At the start of the campaign, all windows on the alchemy chart are closed, so the potion formulas are unknown. The first time that a new combination is brewed during the campaign, open and tear off the corresponding window of the alchemy chart to reveal the potion. Once the potion has been revealed, the action cannot be undone. After the brewing character gains one copy of the brewed potion, move all remaining copies to the available craftable supply.</p><h4 id="alchemist-level-2">Alchemist: Level 2</h4><p>Once the Alchemist has been upgraded to level 2, brewed potions can be distilled. Characters distill a potion by returning it from their pool of items to the available craftable supply. The distilling character gains any one of the herb resources required to brew the potion. If the same potion has been revealed in multiple windows of the alchemy chart, the distilling character can choose one herb resource from any of those potion formulas. Potions that have not yet been revealed on the alchemy chart cannot be distilled.</p><h4 id="alchemist-level-3">Alchemist: Level 3</h4><p>Once the Alchemist has been upgraded to level 3, more powerful potions can be brewed by spending any three herb resources. These three-herb combinations each have their own window on the alchemy chart. All three-herb combinations brewed with two or more of the same herb resource create the same potion, which cannot be distilled.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_67">67</a></strong></p><hr/><h3 id="sell-items">Sell Items</h3><p>Items from a character’s pool can be sold during the Downtime step. When a character gains another copy of an item they already own, they must sell it immediately. When a character sells a purchasable item, they gain gold equal to half its gold cost (rounded down). When a character sells a craftable item, they gain 2 gold for each resource or item required to craft it. Return items to the corresponding available supply when sold.</p><h3 id="purchase-items">Purchase Items</h3><p>Items cannot be purchased freely until building 37 is built.

When a scenario is played in casual mode, all campaign effects are ignored. No event is resolved, time does not pass, and the party does not gain any experience, loot, treasures, checkmarks, personal quest progress, rewards, unlockables, etc. The outcome of the scenario has no impact on the campaign.

Classes may keep all of their previous enhancements, but doing so might cause imbalance. New character sheets for these crossover classes, which include traits and other useful additions, are available at <a href="https://cephalofair.com/frosthaven">cephalofair.com/frosthaven</a>.</p><h3 id="temporary-enhancements">Temporary Enhancements</h3><p>With this variant, enhancement stickers are removed when a character retires. This can be facilitated by affixing the stickers to card sleeves, instead of directly to the ability cards, or by applying reusable stickers (which are sold separately). Temporary enhancements have a reduced cost: First, calculate the normal enhancement cost, including any discounts. Next, if the action has at least one previous enhancement, reduce the cost by 20 gold. Finally, reduce the cost by 20 percent (rounded up).</p><h3 id="reduced-randomness">Reduced Randomness</h3><p>With this variant, parties who want less randomness can reduce the range of outcomes caused by attack modifier cards. Treat all <img alt="Miss Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-miss-icon.png" title="Miss Icon"/> and <img alt="Curse Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-curse-color-icon.png" title="Curse Icon"/> cards as <img alt="-2 Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-minus-2-color-icon.png" title="-2 Icon"/> cards instead, and treat all <img alt="2X Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-2x-icon.png" title="2X Icon"/> and <img alt="Bless icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-bless-color-icon.png" title="Bless icon"/> cards as <img alt="+2 Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-plus-2-color-icon.png" title="+2 Icon"/> cards instead.

Because playing solo reduces uncertainty and makes coordination easier, increase the difficulty by calculating the scenario level differently for solo mode. Take the average level of all characters in the scenario, then add 1 before dividing by 2 and rounding up. For example, on recommended difficulty with three level 4 characters, the scenario level would be ((4 + 4 + 4) ÷ 3 ÷ 2) = 2, but in solo mode it would be ((((4 + 4 + 4) ÷ 3) + 1) ÷ 2) = 3.</p><h3 id="open-information">Open Information</h3><p>With this variant, parties who want fewer restrictions can share exactly which cards they have in hand and discuss specific details about their plans during card selection, which is normally disallowed by the limits on communication. This is not the recommended way to play the game, but some parties may prefer this play style. Because playing with open information reduces uncertainty and makes coordination easier, increase the difficulty by calculating the scenario level as you would for solo mode.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_70">70</a></strong></p><hr/><h3 id="permanent-death">Permanent Death</h3><p>With this variant, the specter of death looms large for parties who want higher stakes. When a character drops to zero hit points, they die instead of becoming exhausted. Characters can still become exhausted if unable to play two cards or perform a long rest, but they survive and can still participate in future scenarios, even if the current scenario is lost.</p><p>When a character dies, they are removed from the campaign at the end of the current scenario. Their personal quest is shuffled back into the deck. Their character materials are put back in the corresponding tuck boxes. Their items are returned to the available supply, their resources are moved to the Frosthaven supply, and their gold is lost. The player whose character died must create a new character during the Downtime step of the next Outpost Phase (or, if the next scenario is force-linked, immediately before the scenario begins).</p><p>When a character becomes exhausted, all normal exhaustion effects still occur, except their figure now remains on the map and can still be targeted by monster attacks and other abilities. Exhausted characters still cannot act in any way, and they are considered to have initiative 99 for the purpose of focusing.</p><h3 id="character-respeccing">Character Respeccing</h3><p>With this variant, parties who want more flexible characters can pay to change their builds. During the Downtime step of the Outpost Phase, any character may spend gold equal to 10 times their current level in order to respec. This allows them to reset all of their previous ability card choices. When a character respecs, they return all ability cards from their pool that are not level 1 or level X, then make a new choice at each level, following the normal rules for leveling up, until they reach their current level.</p><h3 id="random-dungeons">Random Dungeons</h3><p>With this variant, the party can attempt a random dungeon instead of an official scenario, either as part of the ongoing campaign or as a one-off session in casual mode. In either case, no road event is resolved beforehand.</p><p>Each random dungeon has three randomly generated rooms, and the party must clear the monsters from all three rooms in order to complete it. These rooms are revealed one at a time, with each new room only revealed when a character opens the door.

<li><strong>Entrance and Exit Types:</strong> The types of the entrances and exits to the room. These are labeled “A” or “B.” When a room has two exits, the party must choose only one.

For the basic actions, “<img alt="Attack Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-attack-bw-icon.png" title="Attack Icon"/> <strong>2</strong>” is always a top action, and “<img alt="Move Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-move-bw-icon.png" title="Move Icon"/> <strong>2</strong>” is always a bottom action.</li>
<li>Exhaustion does not reduce the number of characters in the scenario, for variables like monster hit points or scenario effects.</li>
</ul><h3 id="summons">Summons</h3><ul>
<li>Summons must be placed in empty hexes adjacent to the summoner. If there is no adjacent hex available, the figure is not summoned.</li>
<li>Summons are not directly controlled by their summoner. Most summons instead obey automated monster rules.</li>
</ul><h3 id="loot-and-elements">Loot and Elements</h3><ul>
<li>All monsters, except scenario allies, drop a loot token when they die.</li>
<li>All characters loot the hex they occupy at the end of their turn, not the end of each movement. Monsters and summons do not perform end-of-turn looting.</li>
<li>Since infusions don’t occur until the end of the turn, any consumed element must be already strong or waning at the start of the turn, prior to any infusions.</li>
</ul><h3 id="scenario-details">Scenario Details</h3><ul>
<li>The recommended scenario level is half the average character level (rounded up).</li>
<li>Characters can each bring into a scenario a number of small items equal to half their level (rounded up).</li>
<li>The end of a scenario can only occur at the end of a round.</li>

<p><strong>Stop! Do not read this appendix until building 44 is built.</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>Each type of enhancement has a base cost, which is determined by the following cost chart. The cost might then be modified based on which ability is being enhanced. If applicable, apply the following cost modifiers, one at a time, in order:</p><ol>
<li>
<p>If the ability targets multiple figures or tiles, double the cost. This applies to abilities that summon or affect multiple allies or tokens and to abilities that can target multiple figures or tiles. This does not apply to target, area-of-effect hex, or element enhancements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the action has a lost icon, but no persistent icon, halve the cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the ability provides a persistent bonus, whether or not the action has a lost icon, triple the cost. This does not apply to summon stat enhancements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each level of the ability card above level 1, add 25 gold to the cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each enhancement already on the action, add 75 gold to the cost.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Some enhancements do not fall neatly into the categories on the cost chart. When determining their base cost, treat damage traps as “<img alt="Attack Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-attack-bw-icon.png" title="Attack Icon"/> <strong>+1</strong>” enhancements (50 gold), treat healing traps as “<img alt="Heal Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-heal-bw-icon.png" title="Heal Icon"/> <strong>+1</strong>” enhancements (30 gold), and treat the movement of tokens and tiles as “<img alt="Move Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-move-bw-icon.png" title="Move Icon"/> <strong>+1</strong>” enhancements (30 gold).</p><div class="table-responsive">
