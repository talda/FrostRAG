<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> Commanding figures is a targeted ability that allows a figure to command another figure to perform certain abilities. There are two ways to command figures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grant:</strong> Allows a figure to grant an ability to any figure. The commanded figure then performs that ability. If the commanded figure is a character summon or scenario ally, the commanding figure decides how the ability is performed.</li>
<li><strong>Control:</strong> Allows a figure to control an ability of an enemy. The commanded figure then performs that ability, and the commanding figure decides how the ability is performed. During this ability, the commanded figure treats the commanding figure’s allies and enemies as their own allies and enemies. When a move ability is controlled, it is considered forced movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an attack ability is granted or controlled, the commanded figure uses their normal attack modifier deck. An attack ability cannot be granted or controlled if the commanded figure has no valid targets or is affected by a negative condition that prevents the attack ability.</p>
<p>A figure can be commanded to perform a “<img alt="Attack Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-attack-bw-icon.png" title="Attack Icon"/> <strong>X</strong>” or”<img alt="Move Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-move-bw-icon.png" title="Move Icon"/> <strong>X</strong>” ability, even if they have no attack or move stat value. However, a figure cannot be commanded to perform a “<img alt="Attack Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-attack-bw-icon.png" title="Attack Icon"/> <strong>± X</strong>” or “<img alt="Move Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-move-bw-icon.png" title="Move Icon"/> <strong>± X</strong>” ability if they have no attack or move stat value. A commanded figure retains all of their persistent bonuses and special traits. A commanded ability is not considered a separate turn. Objectives cannot be commanded.</p>
