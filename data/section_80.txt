<h3 id="character-damage">Character Damage</h3><p>When a character would suffer any amount of damage</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> (after ward or brittle is applied),</p>
</blockquote><p>they must either reduce their red hit point dial by that amount or negate the damage. Damage can be negated in two ways:</p><ol type="A">
<li><strong>Ability or Effect:</strong> The character may use an active ability or effect which negates damage.</li>
<li><strong>Card Loss:</strong> The character may lose one card of their choice from their hand, or two cards of their choice from their discard pile, to negate the damage. If they have not yet taken their turn, the cards they selected during the Card Selection step are not in their hand or discard pile and therefore cannot be lost to negate the damage.</li>
</ol><p>Even if the damage is negated, effects or conditions from the source of damage are still applied.</p>
