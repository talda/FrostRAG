<h2 id="campagain-sheet">Campagain Sheet</h2><p>The party has a single campaign sheet that tracks a variety of information related to the campaign. The pad contains multiple sheets, in case they are needed for any reason, but only one campaign can be in progress at any given time.</p><p>The campaign sheet has the following:</p><ol type="A">
<li><strong>Campaign Calendar:</strong> This tracks the passage of time, measured in weeks. When the party returns to Frosthaven after a scenario, mark the next box. You might also be instructed to mark the next box at other times in the campaign. Marking these boxes can have various effects (see <a href="#page_59">p.59</a>).There are 10 weeks per season and two seasons, summer and winter, per year. If the campaign lasts longer than four years, use a new campaign sheet to continue tracking the passage of time.</li>
<li><strong>Frosthaven Supply:</strong> This tracks the party’s resources. Any material resources here can be used to pay various costs for buildings, while any herb resources here can be used to craft items and brew potions. All resources here can be used to pay collective costs from scenarios or events. At any time, characters can move resources from their personal supplies to the Frosthaven supply, but they cannot move resources from the Frosthaven supply to their personal supplies.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration Value:</strong> This marks the party’s current inspiration. When the party receives “±X inspiration,” adjust this value accordingly. When the party completes a scenario, they gain inspiration equal to 4 minus the number of characters. The party can spend any amount of inspiration in place of an equal number of material resources when paying various costs for buildings. Characters can spend 15 inspiration when retiring to complete an additional personal quest (see <a href="#page_64">p.64</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Total Defense Value:</strong> This marks Frosthaven’s current defense. This value is mainly referenced when resolving attack events (see <a href="#page_60">p.60</a>). When the party receives “±X defense,” adjust this value accordingly. Modifiers from the morale track are not cumulative; only the current modifier is applicable.</li>
<li><strong>Soldiers:</strong> These can be spent during an attack event to improve the chances of success on any defense check (see <a href="#page_61">p.61</a>). When the party gains or loses X soldiers, mark or erase X circles accordingly. The maximum number of soldiers the party can have is limited by the current level of the Barracks.</li>
<li><strong>Morale Track:</strong> This marks Frosthaven’s current morale. Certain event outcomes have a morale requirement, and Frosthaven’s total defense is affected by the modifier indicated next to the current morale (see <a href="#page_61">p.61</a>). When the party receives “±X morale,” adjust this track accordingly. The party can lose 1 morale to perform a repair, instead of spending resources (see <a href="#page_61">p.61</a>), and they can lose 2 morale to perform an extra build or upgrade (see <a href="#page_68">p.68</a>). The morale track has a minimum value (0) and a maximum value (20).If the minimum or maximum is ever reached, read the indicated section from the section book. The party’s starting morale is determined at the end of scenario 1.</li>
<li><strong>Campaign Stickers:</strong> This tracks the party’s campaign stickers. When the party gains a campaign sticker, affix it here. If one campaign sticker is gained and another lost at the same time, cover the old sticker with the new one. Having a specific campaign sticker can change the outcome of an event or scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Prosperity Track:</strong> This marks Frosthaven’s current prosperity. The prosperity level determines the maximum starting level for new characters (see <a href="#page_65">p.65</a>) and the maximum level for building upgrades (see <a href="#page_68">p.68</a>). When the party receives “+X prosperity,” mark the next X boxes. Each time a numbered box is marked, the prosperity level increases. When the party receives “-X prosperity,” erase the previous X boxes, but never erase a numbered box or further.</li>
</ol><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_55">55</a></strong></p><hr/><ol start="9" type="A">
<li><strong>Retirement Table:</strong> This serves as an ongoing record of retired characters. When a character retires (see <a href="#page_64">p.64</a>), record their information in this table. The number of characters a player has retired during the campaign determines how many bonus perk marks are gained by newly created characters (see <a href="#page_63">p.63</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Town Guard Perks:</strong> These relate to a mechanism that is introduced during the campaign. This can be ignored until building 90 is built.</li>
