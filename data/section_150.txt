<h3 id="character-respeccing">Character Respeccing</h3><p>With this variant, parties who want more flexible characters can pay to change their builds. During the Downtime step of the Outpost Phase, any character may spend gold equal to 10 times their current level in order to respec. This allows them to reset all of their previous ability card choices. When a character respecs, they return all ability cards from their pool that are not level 1 or level X, then make a new choice at each level, following the normal rules for leveling up, until they reach their current level.</p>
