<h3 id="overlay-tiles">Overlay Tiles</h3><p>Overlay tiles are placed on top of map tiles to provide additional features for the scenario. The type of overlay tile is defined by the colored border of the tile, as depicted in the scenario book, not necessarily the illustration on the tile.</p><p>If the scenario layout depicts an overlay tile covering the border hex of a map tile, the overlay tile also covers up any adjacent wall lines. The overlay tile creates new wall lines between it and any adjacent border hexes without overlay tiles.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> A hex with no overlay tiles (except corridors and pressure plates) is considered <strong>featureless</strong>. A hex with no figure is considered <strong>unoccupied</strong>. A hex that is both featureless and unoccupied is considered <strong>empty</strong>. Tokens are not overlay tiles.</p>

<td><strong>Note:</strong> Many overlay tiles can function as different types of overlays. For example, a snow rock tile can be used as A an obstacle, B an objective, or C a wall, depending on the border shown in the scenario layout and banner color shown in the scenario key. The type of overlay is determined by its color and icon, not necessarily the illustration on the tile or name in the scenario book.</td>

All doors are closed to start. When a character enters a closed door, they flip over the door tile to its open side, revealing the adjacent room (see <a href="#page_44">p.44</a>). Closed doors do not hinder normal character movement, but they otherwise act as walls. No figure can enter a closed door with forced movement (see <a href="#page_32">p.32</a>). Once a door is open, it is considered a corridor for most purposes, but it still separates rooms and is not part of either room adjacent to it. Door illustrations vary by environment type, but all door tiles function identically.</p><h4 id="corridors">Corridors</h4><p><img alt="Corridor Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-corridor-color-icon.png" title="Corridor Icon" width="42"/>  A corridor is placed on the connection of two map tiles to cover the border hexes and create a single room out of multiple map tiles. Corridors are considered empty hexes and are <strong>not</strong> considered to be overlay tiles for the purposes of determining what other tiles or tokens can be placed in the same hex.</p><h4 id="pressure-plates">Pressure Plates</h4><p><img alt="Pressure Plate Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-pressure-plate-color-icon.png" title="Pressure Plate Icon" width="42"/>  A pressure plate‚Äôs trigger and all of its effects are defined by the special rules for the scenario. Jump and flying movements still trigger pressure plates. Pressure plates are considered empty hexes.</p><h4 id="traps">Traps</h4><p><img alt="Trap Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-trap-color-icon.png" title="Trap Icon" width="42"/>  A trap is sprung when any figure enters its hex, except when flying or jumping (unless the jump movement ends there).When a trap is sprung, it applies some effect to the figure who sprang it and is then removed from the map. Trap effects are varied and are specified either by the scenario key‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif they are a part of a room‚Äôs setup‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor by the ability of the figure who placed the trap. If part of a trap‚Äôs effect is listed as ‚Äúdamage‚Äù in the scenario key, the trap will deal damage equal to 2 plus the scenario level (see <a href="#page_16">p.16</a>).</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> When a trap tile is placed on the map, tokens for the damage and conditions it applies should be placed on the trap tile for easy reference.</p>
</blockquote><h4 id="hazardous-terrain">Hazardous Terrain</h4><p><img alt="Hazardous Terrain Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-hazardous-terrain-color-icon.png" title="Hazardous Terrain Icon" width="42"/>  If any figure enters a hazardous terrain hex, except when flying or jumping (unless the jump movement ends there),</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> that figure suffers damage equal to 1 plus one-third of the scenario level, rounded up (see <a href="#page_16">p.16</a>). 
Unlike trap tiles, hazardous terrain tiles are not removed after their effect is applied; instead they remain on the map indefinitely. Figures do not suffer additional damage when starting a turn in a hazardous terrain tile or exiting a hazardous terrain hex.</p>
</blockquote><h4 id="difficult-terrain">Difficult Terrain</h4><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> <img alt="Difficult Terrain Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-difficult-terrain-color-icon.png" title="Difficult Terrain Icon" width="42"/>  A figure requires 2 movement points to enter a difficult terrain hex, except when flying or jumping (even if the jump movement ends there).</p>
</blockquote><h4 id="icy-terrain">Icy Terrain</h4><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> <img alt="Icy Terrain Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-icy-terrain-color-icon.png" title="Icy Terrain Icon" width="42"/>  If any figure enters an icy terrain hex, except when teleporting, flying, or jumping (even if the jump movement ends there), that figure is forced to move one additional hex, without spending a movement point, in the same direction as the movement that caused them to enter the hex. This extra movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, but it will not occur if it would cause the figure to move through a wall line or to enter a hex occupied by another figure, obstacle, or objective. If the movement causes the figure to enter another icy terrain hex, the effect triggers again.</p>
</blockquote><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">üîù</a>¬† ¬†<a name="page_15">15</a></strong></p><hr/><h4 id="obstacles">Obstacles</h4><p><img alt="Obstacles Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-obstacle-color-icon.png" title="Obstacles Icon" width="42"/>  Figures cannot enter a hex with an obstacle, except when flying or jumping (unless the jump movement would end there). Obstacles do not block line-of-sight (see <a href="#page_21">p.21</a>).</p><h4 id="objectives">Objectives</h4><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> <img alt="Objectives Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-objective-color-icon.png" title="Objectives Icon" width="42"/>  Objectives are tied to the goals of some scenarios and typically need to be destroyed or protected. In either case, the special rules for the scenario will assign a maximum hit point value to each objective, usually based on the scenario level (see <a href="#page_16">p.16</a>) and the number of characters. Objectives can be targeted by attacks and suffer damage, but are immune to all conditions and forced movement. Objectives are considered to have initiative 99 for the purpose of focusing, unless otherwise stated by the special rules for the scenario, but do not take turns. Any damage an objective suffers is marked by placing damage tokens directly on it. When the total damage suffered by an objective is equal to or greater than its maximum hit point value, the objective is destroyed, and the objective tile is removed from the map. Objectives are considered figures, and the hexes they are in are considered occupied. Objectives are not considered obstacles.</p>
</blockquote><h4 id="walls">Walls</h4><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> <img alt="Walls Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-wall-color-icon.png" title="Walls Icon" width="42"/>  Like the walls on the border of a map tile, figures cannot cross the wall lines into a wall hex by any means, even when flying or jumping. Any section of a map tile surrounded by wall lines is considered to be a separate room.</p>
</blockquote><h4 id="treasures">Treasures</h4><p><img alt="Treasure Goal Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-goal-treasure-icon.png" title="Treasure Goal Icon" width="42"/>  Treasure can be looted by characters (see <a href="#page_32">p.32</a>). When a treasure is looted, its effect is applied and the treasure tile is removed from the map.</p><p><img alt="Numbered Treasure Icon" src="icons/overlay-tiles/fh-overlay-tile-numbered-treasure-icon.png" title="Numbered Treasure Icon" width="42"/>  Goal treasure is related to the completion of a scenario, with effects specified in the special rules for the scenario. Numbered treasure is more varied, with effects specified in the Treasure Index (see <a href="#page_78">p.78</a>).</p><ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> If the treasure provides an item, find one copy of that item in the unavailable supply and add it to your pool of items. You may then use it normally for the remainder of the scenario as if you had brought it into the scenario, even if it puts you above the limit for that type of item (see <a href="#page_35">p.35</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>If the treasure provides an item blueprint, find all copies of that item in the unavailable supply and add them to the available craftable supply (see <a href="#page_58">p.58</a>).</li>
<li>If the treasure provides a random item blueprint, draw a card from the shuffled random item blueprint deck and add it and all other copies of that item (found in the unavailable craftable supply) to the available craftable supply (see <a href="#page_58">p.58</a>).

<li>If the treasure unlocks a random scenario, draw a card from the random scenario deck, read the section specified on the card in the section book, and then remove the card from the game.
