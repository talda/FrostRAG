<h3 id="monster-stat-cards">Monster Stat Cards</h3><p>Each monster type has a double-sided <strong>monster stat card</strong>, which determines its base stats at every level. To set the level for a monster type, its stat card is inserted in a stat sleeve so that only the relevant stats are shown. Each stat sleeve has a six-section side and a 10-section side. The side to use for a monster type depends on whether that type has four to six standees or 10 standees.</p><p>A monster stat card can have the following:</p><ol type="A">
<li><strong>Monster Name:</strong> The name of the monster type.</li>
<li><strong>Monster Level:</strong> This level, which matches the scenario level, indicates how to insert the stat card into the stat sleeve.</li>
