<h1 id="scenario-phase">Scenario Phase</h1><p>Scenarios are self-contained missions designed to be played in a single sitting. The campaign of Frosthavenspans numerous scenarios, and most of your time in the campaign will be spent playing through these scenarios. The scenario book contains 138 scenarios, but you will not play through them all, and they will not be played in order. The story contains many branching paths and detours.</p><p>Each Scenario Phase consists of three distinct steps:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Beginning a Scenario</strong>: In this step, the party will prepare everything needed for the scenario, including their own characters, the monsters they will fight against, and the map layout where the fight will occur.</li>
<li><strong>Playing a Scenario</strong>: This step occurs over a series of rounds. Within each round, all figureson the map, both characters and monsters, will take a turn. The party will play through round after round until the scenario is lost or completed.</li>
<li><strong>Ending a Scenario</strong>: In this step, the party will resolve the effects of losing or completing the scenario.</li>
