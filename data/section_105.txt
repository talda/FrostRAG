<h2 id="building-deck">Building Deck</h2><p>The building deck contains a card for every interactable building that currently exists in Frosthaven. The starting building deck consists of the Barracks (level 1), Craftsman (level 1), Alchemist (level 1), and Workshop (level 1). At the start of the campaign, apply any one-time effects indicated on these cards.</p><p>The cards in the building deck should always be arranged in sequential order based on their reference numbers. If a building has multiple levels, only the card corresponding to its current level should be in the deck. Each card has a normal side and a wrecked side. When the status of a building changes, its card is flipped accordingly. All building cards not in the building deck should remain separate or stored in their original envelopes.</p><p>A building card has the following:</p><ol type="A">
