<h3 id="random-dungeons">Random Dungeons</h3><p>With this variant, the party can attempt a random dungeon instead of an official scenario, either as part of the ongoing campaign or as a one-off session in casual mode. In either case, no road event is resolved beforehand.</p><p>Each random dungeon has three randomly generated rooms, and the party must clear the monsters from all three rooms in order to complete it. These rooms are revealed one at a time, with each new room only revealed when a character opens the door. Generate each room by drawing a random room card and a random setup card.</p><p>Build the loot deck with 24 cards: 12 money cards, two cards of each material resource, and one card of each herb resource.</p><h4 id="random-room-card">Random Room Card</h4><p>A random room card contains the following:</p><ol type="A">
<li><strong>Noun Title:</strong> A noun title. When combined with the adjective title from the random setup card, this creates the full title of the room.</li>
<li><strong>Map Tiles:</strong> The map tiles for the room. Any required overlay tiles will be shown, as well as 12 map designations for the placement of various features shown on the random setup card. If the overlay tiles of a specific type run out by the second or third room, use any comparable overlay tiles instead.</li>
<li><strong>Entrance and Exit Locations:</strong> The locations of the entrances and exits to the room. These always correspond to the closest border hex of the map tile with a puzzle connection. In the first room, each character starts on any empty hex within two hexes of the entrance. If the first room has two entrances, the party must choose only one.</li>
<li><strong>Entrance and Exit Types:</strong> The types of the entrances and exits to the room. These are labeled “A” or “B.” When a room has two exits, the party must choose only one. When a room has two entrances, the party must use the entrance that matches their chosen exit from the previous room. If the back of the next room card does not show a matching entrance, discard until a card with a matching entrance appears.</li>

<li><strong>Penalties:</strong> The penalties for revealing the room. For recommended difficulty, apply no penalty for the first room, the minor penalty for the second room, and the major penalty for the third room. The party can scale the difficulty as they wish by adjusting the number and severity of these penalties. If the penalty of the first room refers to the character who opened the door, the party can decide who it applies to.</li>
</ol><h4 id="random-setup-card">Random Setup Card</h4><p>A random setup card contains the following:</p><ol type="A">
<li><strong>Adjective Title:</strong> An adjective title. When combined with the noun title from the random room card, this creates the full title of the room.</li>
<li><strong>Setup Features:</strong> A list of monsters, tiles, and tokens in the room. Place these features in their indicated hexes in the room by referencing the 12 map designations shown on the random room card. As in the normal setup for a scenario, the placement and rank of monsters is based on the number of characters in the party.</li>
<li><strong>Elemental Infusion:</strong> When this room is revealed, infuse any depicted element at the end of the current turn.</li>
<li><strong>Treasure Contents:</strong> The contents of any treasure tiles in the room. Specific loot that is important to the campaign will never appear in a random dungeon.</li>
<li><strong>Trap Types:</strong> The types of any traps in the room.</li>
