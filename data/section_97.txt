<h1 id="ending-a-scenario">Ending a Scenario</h1><p>When a scenario ends, it is either lost or completed, depending on which conditions occur. The scenario is lost if all characters become exhausted or some other loss condition listed in the scenario rules occurs. The scenario is completed if the specific goal listed in the scenario rules is achieved.</p><p>Once the end of the scenario is triggered, play continues until the current round is over, and then the scenario ends. If the scenario would be both lost and completed in the same round, the scenario is lost.</p><p>Each character recovers all of their discarded and lost ability cards, recovers all of their spent and lost items, and resets their red dial to their maximum hit point value. All conditions are removed from the characters.

All battle goals are shuffled back into the battle goal deck.</p><p>If there are any loot tokens or treasure tiles still on the map when the scenario ends, they cannot be looted. Looting can only be performed during the scenario.</p><p>Each character notes how much experience they gained during the scenario. The base experience is shown on their blue dial. If the scenario was completed, each character gains bonus experience based on the scenario level (see <a href="#page_16">p.16</a>). The total is then added to the current experience total on their character sheet.</p><p>Each character notes how much gold they gained during the scenario.</p><blockquote>

Whether the scenario was lost or completed, this amount is multiplied by the current conversion rate, which is based on the scenario level (see <a href="#page_16">p.16</a>).</p>
