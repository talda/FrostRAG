<h2 id="2-outpost-event">2. Outpost Event</h2><p>After the Passage of Time step, unless you were instructed not to resolve an outpost event this week, draw the top card of the active outpost event deck and resolve it. If the calendar shows summer, draw a summer outpost event. If the calendar shows winter, draw a winter outpost event. Outpost events are resolved exactly like road events (see <a href="#page_12">p.12</a>).</p>
