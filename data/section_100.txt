<li><strong>Scenario Conclusion:</strong> Read the conclusion of the scenario, which is found in the section indicated by the specific goal for the scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario Rewards:</strong> Gain any scenario rewards listed after the conclusion. However, the rewards from each scenario can only be gained once per campaign, so skip this step if replaying a completed scenario. These rewards can include scenario unlocks, experience, gold, checkmarks, items, and more. If the party is required to lose something, they cannot lose more than they have. If an item is gained, find one copy of that item in the unavailable supply and add it to any character‚Äôs pool of items. If an item blueprint is gained, find all copies of that item in the unavailable supply and add them to the available supply.

<p>If another scenario is linked <img alt="Linked Scenario Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-linked-bw-icon.png" title="Linked Scenario Icon"/> to the completed scenario, they may skip the Outpost Phase and play it. If another scenario is force-linked <img alt="Force-Linked Scenario Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-linked-forced-color-icon.png" title="Force-Linked Scenario Icon"/> to the completed scenario, they must skip the Outpost Phase and play it. If this was not the first time the scenario was completed during the same campaign, all scenario links are ignored and the party must return to Frosthaven for an Outpost Phase.</p>
