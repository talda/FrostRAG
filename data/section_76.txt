<h3 id="experience">Experience</h3><p><img alt="Experience Icon" src="icons/general/fh-xp-bw-icon.png" title="Experience Icon" width="42"/>  Experience measures a character’s growth and defines when they level up. When an action depicts an experience icon <img alt="Experience Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-xp-bw-icon.png" title="Experience Icon"/> in the lower right corner, if any part of that action is performed, the character gains the indicated amount of experience. Experience that a character gains during a scenario is tracked on their blue experience dial.</p><p>Sometimes an ability specifies that experience is only gained under certain conditions, such as consuming an element, meeting a requirement, or advancing a character token past an experience icon <img alt="Experience Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-xp-bw-icon.png" title="Experience Icon"/> between use slots.</p><p>Characters do not automatically gain experience by killing monsters; they must perform specific abilities during a scenario to do so.</p>
