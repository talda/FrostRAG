Construction</h2><p>After the Downtime step, the party may build, upgrade, and rebuild buildings. <strong>They may build or upgrade one building by default, and they may lose 2 morale to build or upgrade a second building.</strong> Buildings cannot be upgraded while wrecked.

<h3 id="carpenter">Carpenter</h3>
<p>Once the Carpenter has been built, the cost to build, upgrade, or rebuild any building is reduced by any one material resource. Once the Carpenter has been upgraded to level 2, the party only loses 1 morale (not 2) if they wish to build or upgrade a second building during the Construction step. If the Carpenter is wrecked, these bonuses do not apply.</p>

When a scenario is played in casual mode, all campaign effects are ignored. No event is resolved, time does not pass, and the party does not gain any experience, loot, treasures, checkmarks, personal quest progress, rewards, unlockables, etc. The outcome of the scenario has no impact on the campaign. However, completed scenarios can be replayed as part of the campaign (i.e., not in casual mode) as long as the party still meets their requirements.</p><h3 id="crossover-classes">Crossover Classes</h3><p>Any unlocked class from another <em>Gloomhaven</em> game can be chosen when creating a new character in <em>Frosthaven</em>.Conversely, any unlocked class from <em>Frosthaven</em> can be chosen when creating a new character in another <em>Gloomhaven</em> game. Classes may keep all of their previous enhancements, but doing so might cause imbalance. New character sheets for these crossover classes, which include traits and other useful additions, are available at <a href="https://cephalofair.com/frosthaven">cephalofair.com/frosthaven</a>.</p><h3 id="temporary-enhancements">Temporary Enhancements</h3><p>With this variant, enhancement stickers are removed when a character retires. This can be facilitated by affixing the stickers to card sleeves, instead of directly to the ability cards, or by applying reusable stickers (which are sold separately). Temporary enhancements have a reduced cost: First, calculate the normal enhancement cost, including any discounts. Next, if the action has at least one previous enhancement, reduce the cost by 20 gold. Finally, reduce the cost by 20 percent (rounded up).</p><h3 id="reduced-randomness">Reduced Randomness</h3><p>With this variant, parties who want less randomness can reduce the range of outcomes caused by attack modifier cards. Treat all <img alt="Miss Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-miss-icon.png" title="Miss Icon"/> and <img alt="Curse Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-curse-color-icon.png" title="Curse Icon"/> cards as <img alt="-2 Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-minus-2-color-icon.png" title="-2 Icon"/> cards instead, and treat all <img alt="2X Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-2x-icon.png" title="2X Icon"/> and <img alt="Bless icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/conditions/fh-bless-color-icon.png" title="Bless icon"/> cards as <img alt="+2 Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-plus-2-color-icon.png" title="+2 Icon"/> cards instead. Even though these cards no longer have the same modifiers, the effect of the shuffle icon still applies. Any item effects or other game effects that refer to <img alt="Miss Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-miss-icon.png" title="Miss Icon"/> or <img alt="2X Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/attack-modifiers/fh-2x-icon.png" title="2X Icon"/> cards are unaffected.</p><h3 id="solo-mode">Solo Mode</h3><p>A single player can play solo by controlling two or more characters. Because playing solo reduces uncertainty and makes coordination easier, increase the difficulty by calculating the scenario level differently for solo mode. Take the average level of all characters in the scenario, then add 1 before dividing by 2 and rounding up. For example, on recommended difficulty with three level 4 characters, the scenario level would be ((4 + 4 + 4) ÷ 3 ÷ 2) = 2, but in solo mode it would be ((((4 + 4 + 4) ÷ 3) + 1) ÷ 2) = 3.</p><h3 id="open-information">Open Information</h3><p>With this variant, parties who want fewer restrictions can share exactly which cards they have in hand and discuss specific details about their plans during card selection, which is normally disallowed by the limits on communication. This is not the recommended way to play the game, but some parties may prefer this play style. Because playing with open information reduces uncertainty and makes coordination easier, increase the difficulty by calculating the scenario level as you would for solo mode.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_70">70</a></strong></p><hr/><h3 id="permanent-death">Permanent Death</h3><p>With this variant, the specter of death looms large for parties who want higher stakes. When a character drops to zero hit points, they die instead of becoming exhausted. Characters can still become exhausted if unable to play two cards or perform a long rest, but they survive and can still participate in future scenarios, even if the current scenario is lost.</p><p>When a character dies, they are removed from the campaign at the end of the current scenario. Their personal quest is shuffled back into the deck. Their character materials are put back in the corresponding tuck boxes. Their items are returned to the available supply, their resources are moved to the Frosthaven supply, and their gold is lost. The player whose character died must create a new character during the Downtime step of the next Outpost Phase (or, if the next scenario is force-linked, immediately before the scenario begins).</p><p>When a character becomes exhausted, all normal exhaustion effects still occur, except their figure now remains on the map and can still be targeted by monster attacks and other abilities. Exhausted characters still cannot act in any way, and they are considered to have initiative 99 for the purpose of focusing.</p><h3 id="character-respeccing">Character Respeccing</h3><p>With this variant, parties who want more flexible characters can pay to change their builds. During the Downtime step of the Outpost Phase, any character may spend gold equal to 10 times their current level in order to respec. This allows them to reset all of their previous ability card choices. When a character respecs, they return all ability cards from their pool that are not level 1 or level X, then make a new choice at each level, following the normal rules for leveling up, until they reach their current level.</p><h3 id="random-dungeons">Random Dungeons</h3><p>With this variant, the party can attempt a random dungeon instead of an official scenario, either as part of the ongoing campaign or as a one-off session in casual mode. In either case, no road event is resolved beforehand.</p><p>Each random dungeon has three randomly generated rooms, and the party must clear the monsters from all three rooms in order to complete it. These rooms are revealed one at a time, with each new room only revealed when a character opens the door. Generate each room by drawing a random room card and a random setup card.</p><p>Build the loot deck with 24 cards: 12 money cards, two cards of each material resource, and one card of each herb resource.</p><h4 id="random-room-card">Random Room Card</h4><p>A random room card contains the following:</p><ol type="A">
<li><strong>Noun Title:</strong> A noun title. When combined with the adjective title from the random setup card, this creates the full title of the room.</li>
<li><strong>Map Tiles:</strong> The map tiles for the room. Any required overlay tiles will be shown, as well as 12 map designations for the placement of various features shown on the random setup card. If the overlay tiles of a specific type run out by the second or third room, use any comparable overlay tiles instead.</li>
<li><strong>Entrance and Exit Locations:</strong> The locations of the entrances and exits to the room. These always correspond to the closest border hex of the map tile with a puzzle connection. In the first room, each character starts on any empty hex within two hexes of the entrance. If the first room has two entrances, the party must choose only one.</li>
<li><strong>Entrance and Exit Types:</strong> The types of the entrances and exits to the room. These are labeled “A” or “B.” When a room has two exits, the party must choose only one. When a room has two entrances, the party must use the entrance that matches their chosen exit from the previous room. If the back of the next room card does not show a matching entrance, discard until a card with a matching entrance appears.</li>
</ol><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_71">71</a></strong></p><hr/><ol start="5" type="A">
<li><strong>Penalties:</strong> The penalties for revealing the room. For recommended difficulty, apply no penalty for the first room, the minor penalty for the second room, and the major penalty for the third room. The party can scale the difficulty as they wish by adjusting the number and severity of these penalties. If the penalty of the first room refers to the character who opened the door, the party can decide who it applies to.</li>
</ol><h4 id="random-setup-card">Random Setup Card</h4><p>A random setup card contains the following:</p><ol type="A">
<li><strong>Adjective Title:</strong> An adjective title. When combined with the noun title from the random room card, this creates the full title of the room.</li>
<li><strong>Setup Features:</strong> A list of monsters, tiles, and tokens in the room. Place these features in their indicated hexes in the room by referencing the 12 map designations shown on the random room card. As in the normal setup for a scenario, the placement and rank of monsters is based on the number of characters in the party.</li>
<li><strong>Elemental Infusion:</strong> When this room is revealed, infuse any depicted element at the end of the current turn.</li>
<li><strong>Treasure Contents:</strong> The contents of any treasure tiles in the room. Specific loot that is important to the campaign will never appear in a random dungeon.</li>
