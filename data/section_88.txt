<h3 id="monster-attacks">Monster Attacks</h3><p>A monster only attacks on its turn if “<img alt="Attack Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-attack-bw-icon.png" title="Attack Icon"/> <strong>± X</strong>” is listed on its ability card. This attack ability allows the monster to attack using its base attack stat (found on its stat card) modified by X (either positive or negative).</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> The range of the attack is specified on the ability card. If no range is specified, it is a melee attack. If a monster lists multiple targets as an attack effect on its stat card, the number of targets can be modified by “<img alt="Target Icon" class="fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-target-bw-icon.png" title="Target Icon"/> <strong>± X</strong>” effects.</p>
</blockquote><p>A monster only attacks its focus (or foci in the case of multiple targets). When its ability card lists multiple attack abilities, a monster can perform all of those attacks on a single focus. If a monster kills or exhausts its focus and still has attacks remaining, it will use the focus rules to find a new focus.</p><hr/><p align="right"><strong><a href="#page_1">🔝</a>   <a name="page_43">43</a></strong></p><hr/>
