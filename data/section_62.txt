<h3 id="heal">Heal</h3><p><img alt="Heal Icon" src="icons/general/fh-heal-bw-icon.png" title="Heal Icon" width="42"/>  “<strong>Heal X</strong>” is a positive targeted ability that allows the target to heal X amount of damage, increasing their current hit point value. Characters heal damage by rotating their red dial. Monsters heal damage by removing damage tokens from their section of the stat sleeve. A figure’s current hit point value can never exceed their maximum hit point value, though it is permitted to heal a figure that is already at their maximum hit point value.</p><p>Heal effects from attack modifier cards function exactly like heal abilities. If multiple modifiers with heal effects are drawn, they are considered a single heal ability.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> A single heal can remove any combination of wound, brittle, bane, and poison from a figure. However, if poison is present, the hit point increase is prevented.</p>
