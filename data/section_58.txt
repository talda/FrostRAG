<h3 id="flying">Flying</h3><p><img alt="Flying Icon" src="icons/general/fh-flight-bw-icon.png" title="Flying Icon" width="42"/>  “<strong>Flying</strong>” is an active bonus (see <a href="#page_30">p.30</a>). Flying allows a figure to completely ignore all enemies, obstacles, objectives, traps, and overlay terrain, including in the last hex. However, a flying figure still cannot end their movement in a hex occupied by another figure (and vice versa). If a flying figure occupies a hex with an immobilize trap or stun trap (see <a href="#page_29">p.29</a>), treat them as an obstacle when determining the movement of other figures.</p><blockquote>

In such cases, if the figure currently occupies a hex with an obstacle, they instead move into the closest unoccupied hex without an obstacle, triggering any effects of that hex.</p>
