<h3 id="move">Move</h3><p><img alt="Move Icon" src="icons/general/fh-move-bw-icon.png" title="Move Icon" width="42"/>  “<strong>Move X</strong>” is an ability that gives a figure X movement points. That figure may then spend those movement points to move one hex per movement point. Figures can move through allies but cannot move through enemies, obstacles, objectives, or walls. Traps and other effects of hexes trigger when a figure enters them.</p><blockquote>
<p><img alt="Frosthaven Identifier" class="fh-icon new-to-fh-icon" src="icons/general/fh-frosthaven-identifier-color-icon.png" title="Frosthaven Identifier"/> A figure must always end their movement in an unoccupied hex. A figure must enter at least one hex to be considered to have performed a move ability.</p>
</blockquote><p>All unspent movement points are lost at the end of the move ability.</p>
