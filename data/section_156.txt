<h2 id="3-perform-monster-abilities">3. Perform Monster Abilities</h2><p>The monster performs all of its abilities from top to bottom (move, attack, and other abilities). For move abilities, observe the following rules:</p><ol type="A">
<li>The monster must end its movement with a shorter path to its attack hex than it had before or else it will not move.</li>
<li>The monster chooses a movement path that triggers the fewest negative hexes.</li>
<li>The monster moves to an attack hex from which it can attack its focus. If it can target multiple enemies, it instead moves to a hex from which it can attack its focus and the most other enemies.</li>
<li>The monster moves to a hex from which it can attack the most possible targets (including its focus) with the fewest possible disadvantaged attacks.</li>
<li>If the monster could move to multiple hexes that maximize the previous priorities, it moves to the hex that requires the fewest movement points.</li>
<li>In cases where monster movement is still ambiguous, the party decides.</li>
